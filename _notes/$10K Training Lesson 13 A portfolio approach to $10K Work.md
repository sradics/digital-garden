## Highlights
* See, if all you did ==all day was $10K work, you'd be a dreamer==. You'd plan out your future, brainstorm new skills that you could learn or think about your business strategy - but you'd never act on it.
* aim to create a portfolio of activities.
* ==$10/hr work = cash==. It‚Äôs liquid, moves quickly, ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and allows you to function on a daily basis.
* ==$1,000/hr work $1,000/hr work = stocks. This is a sweet spot.== You get price appreciation AND dividends ‚Äì particularly if you are able to play the long game.
* ==$10,000/hr work==
	* Here you have the ==potential for spectacular returns==
	* ==sprinkle some $10k pixie dust into your daily activities==. Even if it‚Äôs just 10 minutes
* age and risk tolerance - two variables to consider when building own work portfolio
* ==the earlier you are in your career, the less agency you have to get rid of $10 and $100 tasks==. (can be interesting for coaching!)
* ==the more you advance professionally, the more you should shift your focus towards the big picture==.
