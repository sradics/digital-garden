y pivotal month on LinkedIn  
  
â†’ 500% higher daily follower growth  
â†’ 25% more total followers (11 years on LN)  
â†’ engagement up 2650% (53 comments/day vs 2/d)  
â†’ impressions up about 70%  
  
  
Such changes need a high investment.  
Each day:  
  
â†’ I create content for about 1.5h  
â†’ I build connections for about 1h  
â†’ I comment and engage for about 3-5h  
  
You may ask why such an investment?  
  
â†’ I grow my audience of Smart Learners  
â†’ I learn what resonates (and what not)  
â†’ I get better at writing/expressing  
â†’ I grow my personal brand  
â†’ I build authority  
  
The cool (side) effect:  
  
â†’ I fed my LinkedIn Second Brain's hunger
