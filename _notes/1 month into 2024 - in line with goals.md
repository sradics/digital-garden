## Content preparation
+ in January I reached the first time ever 3000 minutes Peloton training per month
+ done with a stack of 10-15' meditation,25' yoga, 5' strength, 60-120' cycling
+ embedded in my morning routine to start in the day energized with a sense of accomplishment
+ on weekends I usually extend training
+ From starting with 11 push-ups at start at the year I'm now at 31 push-ups, second round 17 
+ It is interesting to watch the plateaus and that is takes around 2 days for the body to adapt

4 components I apply for my habit building
+ 30-for-30 approach, means to do at least 30 minutes of exercise in 30 consecutive days. What I did now with at least 90 minutes each day
+ followed the 2 day rule, to not skip more than one day in a row when building a new habit. When I can' cycle I have a replacement like walking. But pushed myself to have physical activity each day
+ I apply habit stacking what means to attach a new habit to an existing routine. This way I embedded the push-ups after Yoga and I combine my cycling with thinking about topics I read or analyzed before, to leverage diffused mode learning. 
+ I aim for Minimum Viable Progress each day. I can best feel that with push-ups. Inspired by Goggins I earn my mental cookies each day, by pushing it to the limits. I hate it and I love it afterwards.
