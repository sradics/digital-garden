3 Steps to Stay Motivated Amid Uncertainty  
(Scenarios — Vivid Vision — Backcast Goals)  
  
In a workshop with Graham Norris, I discovered the power of the Uncertainty Mindset. With an uncertainty mindset you:  
↳ build on creating awareness  
↳ activate imagination and  
↳ creativity.  
  
Embracing the unknown and being open to various future possibilities is key.  
  
3 steps to cultivate an Uncertainty Mindset:  
  
1️⃣ Think in Scenarios - Build Stories About Your Aspirational Future  
Develop multiple scenarios to prepare for different futures:  
→ What uncertainties exist?  
→ Elaborate on implications  
→ Name and describe each scenario  
→ How old are you and others in your scenario?  
→ Identify commonalities and differences across 4-5 scenarios  
  
2️⃣ Make Your Vision Vivid  
→ Create an aspirational future by embedding great experiences from your past  
→ Reflect on what is within your control or influence  
→ Make the future concrete  
  
3️⃣ Backcast Your Goals  
→ Work backwards from your long-term goal instead of starting from today  
→ Start with the future and trace back to the present  
  
By following these steps, we:  
💡Enhance problem-solving  
💡Prepare for different potential futures  
💡Increase resilience by being psychologically prepared for uncertainty  
💡Improve goal clarity and reduce constraints from immediate obstacles  
  
What’s your go-to strategy for staying motivated in uncertain times?

## Content preparation

I'm grateful for 1 year membership in the NessLabs community. A community about Mindful Productivity founded by Anne-Laure Le Cunff. Through my one year journey I also observed my behavior being a community member. 

Some highlights I got from being a community member:
+ Through the group writing sessions I discovered brainwriting and for myself emotional brainwriting
+ immersed into the topic of Mindful Productivity - being consciously present in what you're doing, while you're doing it, in conjunction with managing your mental and emotional states
+ I'm just immersing in the course from Collector to Creator
+ like learning about thoughts from peers about Productivity, Lifelong Learning, Creativity
+ learning more about Mind Gardening and the experience and examples from others

I find it super interesting, how I'm engaging in waves with NessLabs. It feels good to look at new insights shared in the community. In these moments I'm turning into an more active member role, providing thoughts and comments. 

Then I'm switching off for some moments, but like the reminders of what is going on via a the regular eMail updates on upcoming sessions and content added. In addition I learn a lot through Anne-Laure Le Cunff's awesome writing. The regular newsletters are often a highlight I capture in my Second Brain. Thanks for that consistent work and inspiration!
