* Acronym for five user behavior metrics.
* Also known as Pirate Metrics
User behavior metrics to be tracked: 
1. A — Acquisition (How do users find you?). 
2. A — Activation: The core value of the Product is tested (Do users have a great first experience?). 
3. R — Retention (Do users come back?). 
4. R — Revenue (How do you make money?). 
5. R — Referral (Do users tell others?).

4. R for Retention — Rate at which existing users return to a product or feature. 
5. T for Task Success — Measures user experience behaviors like efficiency, effectiveness, and error rate.

## RICE Scoring Model— Prioritization
Four factors: **Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort**.

> [!info]
> RICE Score (total impact per time worked) = (REACH x IMPACT x CONFIDENCE)/(EFFORT)

### R — Reach: 
1. Answering — How many people each project will affect in a given time period?
2. To avoid bias. 
3. Measured using the estimated number of events/people per time period. 
4. Use reach measurements. 

### I — Impact 
1. To beat the tangled mess of gut feeling. 
2. Measured using impact on an individual person. 

Scoring 3 = massive impact 2 = high impact 1 = medium impact 0.5 = low impact 0.25 = minimal impact 

### C — Confidence 
1. To curb enthusiasm for ill-defined ideas. 
2. Answering — How much support do you really have for your estimates? Scoring 100% = high confidence 80% = medium confidence 50% = low confidence nil = moonshot 

### E — Effort 
1. Measured in person months. 
2. Measures the work that a person can do in a month.

## MoSCow Prioritization
### M — Must-have 
Non-negotiable product needs that are mandatory for the team. 

### S — Should-have 
Important initiatives that are not vital, but add significant value. 

### C — Could-have 
Nice to have initiatives that will have a small impact if left out. 

### W — Will-not-have 
Initiatives that are not of priority for this specific time frame.

## CIRCLES - Product Design

### I - Identify users

### R - Report Customer Needs

### C - Cut through prioritization

### L - List solutions

### E - Evaluate Tradeoffs

### S - Summarize recommendations

## STAR/SOAR - Storytelling
