# 10 components of a Thinking Environment
[Source - Nancy Klein](https://www.timetothink.com/thinking-environment/the-ten-components/](https://www.timetothink.com/thinking-environment/the-ten-components/) shared by Abby for a workshop

## ATTENTION

_Listening without interruption and with interest in where the person will go next in their thinking_

Attention is an act of creation.

## EQUALITY

_Regarding each other as thinking peers, giving equal time to think_

Even in a hierarchy people can be equal as thinkers.

## EASE

_Discarding internal urgency_

Ease creates; urgency destroys.

## APPRECIATION

_Noticing what is good and saying it_

The human mind works best in the presence of appreciation.

## ENCOURAGEMENT

_Giving courage to go to the unexplored edge of thinking by ceasing competition as thinkers_

To be â€˜better thanâ€™ is not necessarily to be â€˜goodâ€™.

## FEELINGS

_Welcoming the release of emotion_

Unexpressed feelings can inhibit good thinking.

## INFORMATION

_Absorbing all the relevant Â facts_Â 

Full and accurate information results in intellectual integrity.

## DIFFERENCE

_Prioritising diversity of group identities and understanding their livedÂ experience_Â 

Reality is diverse. To think for ourselves well we need to surround ourselves with people from different identity groups and to understand as fully as possible their lived experience.

## INCISIVE QUESTIONSTM

_Freeing the human mind of untrue assumptions lived as true_

A wellspring of good ideas lies just beneath an untrue limiting assumption.

## PLACE

_Producing a physical environment_Â _â€“_Â _the room, the listener, your body_Â _â€“_Â _that says,_Â _â€˜__You matter__â€™_

When the physical environment affirms our importance, we think more clearly and boldly.  
When our bodies are cared for and respected, our thinking improves.
