My Emotional Journey: 1,000 done in 3 Years

â†’ 30,000 km Logged with Daily Sessions
â†’ Having fun, grinding, and feeling exhausted

I decided during the Lockdown, back in 2021.

â†’ to invest in my fitness
â†’ I ordered my Peloton; a heavy ticket!
â†’ I remember taking my first rideâ€”OMG.

Should I like it or return it?

I chose to like it and build my routine!

â†’ Got on the bike daily. Started with 30'
â†’ Joined Learning Programs for foundations
â†’ Increased to 45' daily; got stronger each ride
â†’ Discovered the POWER ZONES; got hooked
â†’ Riding now 120', 90', 60', 45', 30' sessions

âž  I formed the routine through
â†³ CONSISTENCY
â†³ SMALL STEPS daily
â†³ making it EASY to start

Leading to:

â†’ reaching soon 22000' this year
â†’ just celebrated 1000 rides 
â†’ being stronger than ever

Is it always easy? NO WAY

Do I sometimes hate it? OH YES

Did I cry on the bike? I admit, yes I did! 
â†’ especially in tough sessions
â†’ when emotions come to the surface
â†’ while your body is consumed and flow appears

âž  I love these moments of full immersion

What is ONE way you immerse?

Happy inspirational Saturday, everyone ðŸŒ»
