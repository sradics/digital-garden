# [[1000 workouts celebration]]

## Iterated

Today marks my 1000th workout with Peloton, rounding off an unbroken 103-week streak! 🎉💪  
  
My journey wasn't embarked upon alone. I owe a significant part of my success to these game-changing philosophies and support systems:  
  
★4 Pillars of Energy: This helped me recognize and reinforce Body and Fitness as an essential foundation of my energy and wellbeing.  
  
★Deliberate Practice: This not only drove me to stay consistent but also to learn from the fantastic instructors at Peloton. Remember, building a habit is a marathon, not a sprint. And it's the relentless practice that polishes perfection.  
  
★5AM Club: The sacred early morning hours became my best ally, creating an oasis of focus and productivity.  
  
Moreover, a standing ovation to Blinkist/GO1 for curating a seamless work-from-home culture that saves me a daily commute of 1.5 hours. This bonus time has allowed me to prioritize my fitness. The results? I've become a power-packed reservoir of energy, with an almost non-existent sick leave record of 0.3% in the last 3.5 years and my motivation is at an all-time high. 🚀
