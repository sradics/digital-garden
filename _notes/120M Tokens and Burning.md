While they debate, I deploy

â†’ $20 bought me development superpowers AND $210 saved.

Since August 22nd, I've been using Cursor as my coding companion.

Then they changed their token limit approach.

Suddenly I had development superpowers.

$20 spent. 120M tokens used (roughly $40 value).

We're only halfway through month one.

What I Built in 14 Days
â€”â€”â€”

â†’ Complete webinar funnel with integrated everything [https://quintsmart.com/learning-ecosystem-webinar](https://quintsmart.com/learning-ecosystem-webinar)

Add to calendar? Built it. 
CRM integration? Done. 
Newsletter flows? Connected.

Canceled Systeme.io: -$200/year saved.

â†’ LinkedIn persona-matching system that reads profiles and suggests personalized messages

This thing is scary good. 
Feed it a LinkedIn profile. 
Get back: persona match, qualification score, and a first message that actually sounds human.

â†’ 4 specialized AI assistants now live and ready [https://assistants.quintsmart.com/](https://assistants.quintsmart.com/)

No more generic prompts. 
Now everyone can work with subject matter experts. 

â†’ My entire digital presence unified Homepage:

[https://quintsmart.com/](https://quintsmart.com/) CRM, landing pages, everything on one system.

Deployed from Cursor to Render.com in seconds. 
Canceled Lovable subscription. 
Built my own calendar integration: -$10/month saved.

â†’ Professional CV that actually works

Fed it my LinkedIn profile. 
Asked for optimized web layout. 
Added print-to-PDF functionality. Done.

No more expensive CV services.

That's 2 weeks of work.  Isn't that absolutely insane?

â€”â€”â€”
Meanwhile, at Friday's job fair... 
â€”â€”â€”

Me: "How's your AI development integration going?"

Companies: "Data privacy concerns..." "Not started yet because..." "Regulations..."

The usual excuses.

â€”â€”â€”
Here's what drives me crazy:
â€”â€”â€”

While businesses hesitate with endless meetings about AI strategy...

Individual developers are building entire ecosystems in weeks.

The gap isn't technical anymore.

It's courage.

â€”â€”â€”
Your move:
â€”â€”â€”

Want to build your own stack and eliminate 25+ tool dependencies?

Let's talk.

I'm happy to share what I've learned.

DM "CURSOR" and I'll send you my complete development setup.

P.S.
What would you build first if you had these capabilities?

P.P.S 
I just did an upgrade to Cursor yearly subscription to make sure I can use these superpowers much longer.
