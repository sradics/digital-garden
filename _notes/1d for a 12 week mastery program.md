üöÄ How I Completed a 12-Week Program in ONE Day (again)  
(Yes, there‚Äôs a system to discover)  
  
I recently got hooked on LinkedIn Mastery by [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAFjpa8B7wpeBT3HiBnn6GitlAjVuum3dLc)[Nat Berman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanielberman/):  
‚Üí A 12-week self-paced program  
‚Üí Packed with videos, working materials, valuable insights, and calls to action  
  
Driven by curiosity, I completed the entire program in ONE day.  
  
This is the seventh time I‚Äôve conquered a self-paced course:  
  
‚Üí Finished it  
‚Üí with high speed  
‚Üí derived actionable insights  
‚Üí with ensured high retention even after weeks  
  
But it wasn‚Äôt always this way!  
Do you face these challenges too?  
  
‚Üí Many don‚Äôt follow through with such programs.  
‚Üí Many have a list of purchased courses but never start.  
‚Üí Most who complete a program (partially) forget most of it weeks later.  
  
I was in that place until I changed my approach to self-paced courses.  
  
5 Keys to success:  
  
üóùÔ∏è full focus > remove any distractions  
üóùÔ∏è take extensive notes while watching  
üóùÔ∏è leverage technology e.g. AI to extract text from images  
üóùÔ∏è watch videos with at least 1.5x speed, 2x speed if possible  
üóùÔ∏è post-process > Add structure, highlights, actions, and links  
  
The Results:  
  
‚Üí Implemented 5 action points immediately  
‚Üí Can recap key takeaways anytime within 15 minutes  
‚Üí Built on these learnings to extend my LinkedIn strategy

How I learnt through a 12-weeks-program in ONE day (again)
(there is a system to discover)

I got hooked by the LinkedIn Mastery by Nat Berman:
+ a 12-week-program
+ designed as a self paced course
+ with videos and working material
+ packed with valuable insights and calls to action

Driven by curiosity I went through the full program in just ONE day. 

I conquered such a self paced course format now for the 7th time:
+ Finished it
+ with high speed
+ derived actionable insights 
+ ensuring that I will retain much of it

But it was not always like that. 

Do you face that challenge too?
+ Many don't follow through such a program.
+ Many sit on a list of purchased coursed, but don't start
+ Most run through a program (partially) and forgot most of it some weeks later

I was in that place. 
Until I changed my approach to work with self paced courses.

5 keys to support:
* full focus, remove any distractions
* I take extensive notes while watching
* I leverage technology e.g. AI to extract text from images
* I watch videos with at least 1.5x speed, partially 2x speed
* I post process and add structure, highlights, actions and links

As a result
* I already implement 5 action points
* I can recap my key take aways anytime within 15 minutes
* I can build on top of these learnings and extend my LinkedIn game
