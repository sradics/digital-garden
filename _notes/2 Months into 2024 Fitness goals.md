It is so simple ... take a small step every day
(How I upped my game 5x)

Daily progress matters a lot. And one area where I apply that is my fitness routine. Fitness if for me an important pillar to unlock my full capacity, creativity and bring in my best self every day.

I use progress goals for that. I want to take a tiny step each day. And in order to improve, I push my limits several times a week. I compare me with my my previous self. This way I can learn about my development.

Some insight 2 months into 2024
+ A month with again 30 active days and 54 hours of exercises leading to a 134 weeks streak in total
+ My second month with more than 3000 minutes of exercise activity
+ I just achieved my 900th Peloton cycling moment
+ I pushed my push-up counter from a sets of first run 11, second run 12 to now set with first run 57, second run 24

The fundamentals for my habit forming journey are based on:
ðŸ“š Atomic Habits by James Clear - discover the power of small progress each day 
ðŸ“š Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins - take the extra mile
ðŸ“š Outlive by Peter Attia - put it in a wider context
