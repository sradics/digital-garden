"In 2 years, will AI have left you behind?"  
â†’ I asked this provocative question in my Second Brain workshop.  
  
Picture your future:  
  
Scenario 1: Mild Progress  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Continuing current learning habits  
â†’ Seeing small improvements  
â†’ Feeling that nagging "I could do better"  
  
Scenario 2: The Warning Zone  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Failing to adapt to rapid tech changes  
â†’ Drowning in information overload  
â†’ Watching opportunities slip away  
  
Scenario 3: The Compound Effect  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Systems that accelerate learning  
â†’ Information working FOR you, not against you  
â†’ Taking the driver's seat in your growth  
  
Your gap between these futures grows every day.  
  
Remember Scenario 3? That's what happens when learning compounds.  
  
It's not magic - it's a system.  
  
I'm packaging this into  
"Compound Learning: Your Exponential Advantage"  
  
Curious? I'll let you know when the workshop opens.  
Comment "FUTURE" or DM me to stay informed.
