Two years ago I started working with taking notes and discovered Tiago Fortes Second Brain approach. I established Obsidian as my primary note taking systems that is connected through plugins with many other tools that I use for capturing,  organizing, distilling and expressing my thoughts. 

With the growing amount of thoughts and connections among them I'm now also really into leveraging AI capabilities to work with my notes. In my recent post about Smart Connections I outlined how this awesome plugin provides an AI layer on top of my notes. 

I'm now able to express thoughts and drill down on ideas very fast. I just asked what are my 20 topics I'm mainly focussing on and got the list with interesting insights among them my focus is on Learning how to Learning, Leadership and Coaching, Investing in Personal Development, Future Skill and Learning Flexibility, Longevity and many more.

My usage has evolved from an initial curiosity and exploration of learning methodologies, through the discovery and application of knowledge management tools, to the creation and sharing of content, and recently more towards community engagement and expressing my thoughts and understanding the ROI of my initiatives.

Exhanced capabilities from 2 years into growing my Second Brain
+ I'm now super fast in leveraging my knowledge. I have less occasions where I have to completely rework a topic and read again a whole book because I forgot most of it
+ I can even better reflect on my learnings and learn about my developments
+ Through a developed behavior and the applied structure I became quite efficient with managing knowledge and waste less time in thinking about structure, searching for information
+ My switching costs reduced a lot. So I'm able to quickly switch topics and later on continue where I stopped. 
+ I find a lot of interesting connections between topics and with some randomness and extended perspective through my AI layer my creativity increased a lot
+ Via my expressed thoughts in my digital garden I can help others very fast and share my knowledge for deep dive and providing impulses
