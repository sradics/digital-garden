Warning: This may cause explosive creativity  
  
â†’ Streaming with: Freewriting, Freelining, Freetalking  
  
  
I attend the Note-MAKING mastery course by Nick Milo.  
Recently, the three Streaming Methods for writing made me reflect.  
  
The main claim of the Streaming Methods:  
âž  Get into a WRITING FLOW.  
Think easily, think quickly, and get your thoughts out.  
  
(Do the editing and structuring in a separate step)  
  
Let's examine the three approaches, their benefits, my method,  
and where I use them.  
  
1)Freewriting  
â€”â€”â€”  
Writing thoughts quickly in sentences without editing.  
  
My approach:  
â†’ Spark-Remark-Relate method  
[https://lnkd.in/eX-wfw8q](https://lnkd.in/eX-wfw8q)  
  
â†’ Just write for 1 to 5 minutes. No STOPs, no EDITs  
  
My applications:  
â†’ for Brainwriting and flushing my emotions to "paper"  
[https://lnkd.in/euytZJvg](https://lnkd.in/euytZJvg)  
â†’ For writing a story and truly following my thoughts  
â†’ Often on my reMarkable when I'm not on my computer  
  
2)Freelining  
â€”â€”â€”  
Writing thoughts as bulleted lines  
  
The benefits:  
â†’ Simpler than sentences  
â†’ It's fast and allows you to flush ideas in a stream.  
  
My approach:  
â†’ I create a note in Obsidian and use bullet-point staccato  
  
My applications:  
â†’ In my daily journal note  
â†’ For collecting initial thoughts for my LinkedIn posts  
â†’ When capturing insights while watching/listening  
  
3)Freetalking  
â€”â€”â€”  
Talking out thoughts that are immediately transcribed.  
  
The benefits:  
â†’ super fast  
â†’ Low-key regarding the technology needed  
  
My approach:  
I discovered VOICEPAL toÂ speak your mind while you walk  
â†’ [https://lnkd.in/eqhR4ugf](https://lnkd.in/eqhR4ugf)  
  
I like the AI that converts long spoken text into structured, shorter form.  
  
My applications:  
â†’ When I'm on my walk  
  
  
Freewriting, Freelining, Freetalking - which ONE catches your attention?  
  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
P.S.  
I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease
