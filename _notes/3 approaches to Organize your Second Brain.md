I use 3 powerful approaches to organize all information  
(and achieve fast retrieval plus random discovery)  
  
Each method addresses a unique scenario, whether I either:  
→ know exactly what I need  
→ vaguely recall the information, or  
→ seek new connections to spark creativity  
  
🔍 1. Maps of Content  
———  
Maps of Content are my go-to for quickly accessing information. I create specialized notes where links are grouped by topics, enriched with my thoughts, and visual cues.  
  
Benefits:  
🟢 Connects information across my Second Brain.  
🟢 Provides fast entry points from different perspectives.  
🟢 Allows for adding meta-information like images and reflections.  
  
Drawbacks:  
🔴 Requires active maintenance.  
🔴 Some connections might be missed.

⚡ 2. P.A.R.A: Organize by Actionability  
———  
The P.A.R.A. method prioritizes actionability, ensuring I stay focused on what matters most. I structure in:  
→Projects: Outcomes that need multiple work sessions.  
→Areas of Responsibility: Ongoing roles and standards.  
→Resources: Topics or themes of interest.  
→Archives: Non-actionable items worth keeping.  
  
Benefits:  
🟢 Enhances actionability and quick access to current topics  
🟢 Adaptable across tools like Obsidian, Google Drive, and Todoist  
  
Drawbacks:  
🔴 Needs regular maintenance  
🔴 It’s one-dimensional, requiring me to remember the structure  
  
✨ 3. AI & Integrated Search  
———  
AI-powered tools like Smart Connections in Obsidian and specialized GPTs help me find new connections and reduce cognitive load.  
  
Benefits:  
🟢 Requires no active maintenance.  
🟢 Encourages serendipitous discoveries.  
🟢 Handles fuzzy search terms effectively.  
  
Drawbacks:  
🔴 Requires scanning through many results, which can be time-consuming.  
🔴 Needs a starting search term, which might limit discovery.

## Content preparation

I use 3 powerful approaches to organize all information

I observe several patterns when I'm looking for information. 
↳ Sometimes I exactly know what I'm looking for and where it belongs to. 
↳ Sometimes I know that I have the information somewhere but have no clue, where exactly. 
↳ Sometime I just want to look for new connection to existing information to get inspired

In order to serve all 3 use cases I rely on 3 different approaches to organize my information: Maps of Content, P.A.R.A and AI+integrated search.

📌 Maps of Content
———
I create special notes, where I collect links grouped by topics and enriched with further thoughts.

detailed example: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_maps-of-content-to-retain-knowledge-fast-activity-7203296914769858562-qYQy?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop

🟢 I actively connect information throughout my Second Brain
🟢 You can add meta-information (images, thoughts) about the connection
🟢 I use it to provide fast entry points to information from different angles
🔴 Needs my active maintenance
🔴 I might miss certain connections

📌 Organize by Actionability with P.A.R.A
———
from highest actionable to lowest, one organize information by:
+ (P)rojects - any outcome you’re committed to that requires more than one work session to complete
+ (A)reas of responsibility -  the roles you take on in life, the ongoing standards to maintain 
+ (R)esources - a topic or theme of ongoing interest
+ (A)rchives - things with no current actionability but worth keeping

🟢 Favors actionability and provides fast entry points to current topics
🟢 I can use the structure across tools. I can e.g. use it in Obsidian (Notes), Google Drive (larger files), Todoist (task)
🔴 Needs my active maintenance
🔴 It is one dimensional and I need to remember the structure

📌 Leverage (AI) and integrated search
———
I use the integrated Smart Connections AI in Obsidian and a specialized GPT to look for new connections. And I leverage the tool specific search capabilities
🟢 it needs no active maintainance
🟢 creates serendipity and I can discover new connections
🟢 I can search with fuzzy terms and don't need to remember my structure. It is a lower cognitive load
🔴 I need to scan through many results and might be slower to find what I need
🔴 I need a search term or starting point
🔴 I might miss information
