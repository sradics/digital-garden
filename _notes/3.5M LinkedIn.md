Visuals for 3K to 6K Followers  
  
â†’ compare and adjust  
  
As mentioned in my post yesterday:  
I grew from 3k followers in July to 6k today.  
With 1k new followers in the past month.  
  
(details: [https://lnkd.in/e7mXhCyx](https://lnkd.in/e7mXhCyx))  
  
In the slides you can drill down on details:  
  
â†’ Impressions/day decreased by about 12%  
â†’ Likes per day increased  
â†’ Comments received per day have increased  
â†’ Connections/Followers per day remained stable  
(with on interesting spike)  
  
I like to compare in two ways:  
â†’ Relative to my previous data  
â†’ Learning from others' data to see potential  
  
I hope this helps put your engagement metrics in perspective too.  
  
Have fun exploring & Wish you a great Sunday  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
P.S.  
I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease
