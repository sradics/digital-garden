I spent $175 on Dan Koe's personal brand course.

â†’ 30 days, 30 emails, 30 tasks. Overwhelming? Absolutely.

I purchased Dan Koe's 30 days - Build A Profitable Personal Brand In 30 Days.

Last week, roughly 2 weeks after the 30 days finished, I looked back at what I learned.

Instead of just 30 emails buried in my inbox, I now have:

â†’ 30 organized notes with instructions and what I actually did 
â†’ My AI assistant Lexicon, that helps me with writing 
â†’ All my key lessons from the 30 days in one place

I can now feed these lessons to a new AI assistant to help me build my personal brand.

â†’ New strategies I use in my newsletter and when I contact people

Maybe you already noticed a difference in my newsletters?

â†’ An updated profile 
â†’ Clearer Landing Page and program description

And - all these lessons are easy to find in my notes.

To get back to the main ideas, I don't need to dig through old emails looking for that one insight. Instead, I go straight to my organized notes with links to important stuff.

The outcome? Knowledge used!
And when the next idea comes, I can build on what I already learned. 
Each lesson builds on the last.

â€”â€”â€” 
P.S. Want the distilled knowledge base version? 
DM or comment 'KNOWING' and I'll share them.

P.P.S I'll show exactly how I did this in my next newsletter.
