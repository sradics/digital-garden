# 4 Tips for forming Habits
## 30-for-30 Approach
This model involves **dedicating 30 ==minutes each day for 30 consecutive days== to improve a specific skill or habit**. The idea is that 30 minutes is a manageable time commitment, and 30 days of consistent effort leads to significant results.

## The Two-Day Rule
This concept suggests **==not skipping more than one day in a row when building a new habit==**. Based on a study in the European Journal of Social Psychology, missing a single day doesn't significantly impact the habit formation process, but it's crucial not to miss two consecutive days.

## Habit Stacking
Popularized by James Clear, habit stacking involves **==attaching a new habit to an existing routine==** or a specific time of the day, making it easier to remember and maintain. Examples include doing a specific activity before bed, upon waking up, or during another daily task.

## Minimum Viable Progress
This approach encourages **==daily effort towards a goal, emphasizing that any progress, no matter how small, is valuable==**. The aim is to do a set amount of work each day (e.g., 30 minutes), but if that's not possible, doing any amount more than zero still contributes to long-term progress.
