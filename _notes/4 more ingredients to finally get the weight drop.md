# 4 more ingredients to finally get the weight drop

I'm on my 76th week streak ofÂ [Peloton Interactive](https://www.linkedin.com/company/peloton-interactive-/)Â training. Finished more than 17000 minutes last year and built strong endurance, strength and formed my strong daily habit.  
  
Still my weight did not change the way I wanted.  
  
Starting this year I added 4 more incredients and my weight dropped by 7 kilos in 25 days.  
  
(1) I defined an OKR for myself about the target weight and conditions for reaching that weight by end of this quarter  
  
(2) I adjusted my nutrition further and removed added sugar and mood snacks in the evening  
  
(3) I added more to my sports mix and combine cycling with strength training, more Yoga and stretching.  
  
(4) And I added more bacteria to my life  
  
I'm feeling strong, even more awake and energised and happy that I found a solution that builds on my already strong foundation of my training habit.
