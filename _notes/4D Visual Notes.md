How I document 4x faster and with a smile

â†’ Visual note-making and AI combined

Imagine you want to create documentation using notes you've already prepared.

Your notes are a mix of text and visuals. 

You have a clear idea of the topic's structure, 
but you need to expand on the details.

Previously, my process looked like this:
â†’ Create one document
â†’ Create the outline
â†’ Copy the notes in that document (duplicate)
â†’ Manually write more details

It took me hours and felt boring. 

However, Excalidraw's writing machine simplifies this entire process.

Excalidraw is a visual note-making extension, 
that I can embed inside my Obsidian note-making app.

Here's how it works, as demonstrated in the video:

â†’ I take my notes and arrange them in one canvas
â†’ Next I define the path with arrows 
â†’ Then I run a script that:

â‡¢ Picks up each note
â‡¢ Asks AI to add some more details
â‡¢ Combines all in one document 

This entire process now takes just 15 minutes, showcasing the power of working with notes as building blocks. 

By visually arranging information and leveraging AI, documentation creation becomes both efficient and engaging.
