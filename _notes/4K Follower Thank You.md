4K Followers; 27% ⬆ in ONE month

→ my twist after 11 years
→ engagement, engagement, engagement

THANK YOU DEAR READER ❤️💙💚💛

I'm on a LinkedIn journey since 11 years.
For 10 years I was mainly consuming.
I looked at LinkedIn as a job market.

I did yet not realize its higher potential to:

→ Learn about trends and topics
→ Build and grow my Personal Brand
→ Form a network of deeper relationships
→ Experiment with ideas and get fast feedback

I got curious on how to share my insights too.
But the first steps where overwhelming:

→ No clue how to write
→ Not yet clear on my focus topic
→ And all the different content formats 🤯

After 219 days of daily posts since 01/24
→ All based on my ideas. 
→ AI mainly to simplify.

My Followers grew by 27% in just ONE month.

And this made the difference - ONE MONTH
➠➠➠ ENGAGEMENT ➠➠➠

→ through comments from you on my posts
→ 30+/day comments I provide daily
→ great direction conversations
→ 20+ new connections/day

Thank YOU for:

→ Taking the time to share your opinion
→ Your forward-thinking and impulses→ Just being AWESOME

You touch my world, I hope I touch yours too!
