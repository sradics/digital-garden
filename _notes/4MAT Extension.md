4MAT + AI = -1 x blind spots.  
  
â†’ Using 4MAT to accelerate what comes after Dan Koe's course  
  
Yesterday I shared how I organized 30 days of Dan Koe's personal brand lessons into actionable knowledge.  
  
(details see [https://lnkd.in/emE5jppD](https://lnkd.in/emE5jppD))  
  
But here's what I didn't mention: What comes next?  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
Instead of guessing, I asked my 4MAT learning assistant.  
  
4MAT looks at any learning topic through 8 phases - covering a complete learning cycle from "Why does this matter?" to "What if I adapt this?"  
  
When I fed it my Dan Koe knowledge base, it revealed three immediate next steps:  
  
â†’ Visualize the frameworks (my brain craves visual connections)  
â†’ Master the 7 steps for better Direct Messages (practical application)  
â†’ Steal like an artist - study great examples systematically  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
This isn't just AI giving random suggestions.  
  
4MAT understands how learning actually works. It knows when you need theory versus practice. When to go deep versus when to experiment.  
  
Instead of wandering through endless "what should I learn next" paralysis, I have a clear learning pathway.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
When you combine 4MAT thinking with AI that knows your knowledge base, you can accelerate your learning journey.  
  
My Learning Ecosystem Mastery participants experienced 4MAT in action yesterday  
in Week 2 of Cohort #02.
