# 4MAT Principles of Learning

## Learning is functional
Functional learning is not just theoretical; it has a direct, beneficial impact on the learner's life or work.

Learning **serves a purpose** and is aimed at helping individuals achieve specific goals or solve problems. It's not just about acquiring knowledge but **applying it to practical situations to improve one's life or work**.

## Real learning leaves us changed
Genuine learning **transforms the learner**. It **changes how they think, behave, or view the world**. This kind of learning has a lasting impact and is not easily forgotten.

## Learning is fundamentally social
Much of what we learn comes **from interacting with others**. **Social interactions, discussions, and collaborations enhance understanding and retention of information**. Learning in social contexts helps in developing communication skills and different perspectives.

## Self-directed learning is the core
When learners **take responsibility for their own learning**, they are more **motivated and engaged**. Self-directed learning encourages **curiosity**, **independence**, and the ability to pursue personal interests and goals.

## Cracking the whip stifles learning
Using **fear, punishment, or excessive pressure to force learning can be counterproductive**. It creates **stress** and **anxiety**, which inhibit the brain's ability to process and retain information. A positive and supportive environment is more effective for learning.

Actually this means currently one needs to escape school system (in Germany) as early as possible.
## Learning needs a supportive environment
A **safe, encouraging, and resource-rich environment** fosters better learning. Support from **teachers, peers, and family, as well as access to learning materials and technology**, enhances the learning experience.

## Sometimes the best learning is unlearning
Letting go of **outdated or incorrect information and beliefs** is crucial for progress. Unlearning involves **challenging existing assumptions** and making room for new, more accurate understandings.

## Failing to learn is often the fault of the system
When learners struggle, it's often due to **flaws in the educational system** rather than their own abilities. Issues such as **poor teaching methods, lack of resources, and rigid curricula can hinder learning**.

## People need to learn about what matters to them
Learning is **more effective when it aligns with the learner's interests, needs, and goals.** Relevance and personal significance drive motivation and engagement in the learning process.

## Learning is conceptual in nature and creates visual images
**Effective learning involves understanding concepts and forming mental images.** This **deepens comprehension** and helps in recalling and applying knowledge in different contexts.

Thats why 4MAT step 3R invest on creating the mental image and connect to the concept introduced in 1R and transported throughout the full learning cycle.

## Learning needs to promote a mindset that endures beyond the teaching
Education should aim to **instill a lifelong love of learning and critical thinking skills**. Learners should develop a mindset that values continuous growth, adaptability, and curiosity beyond formal education.

## Learning by doing is more powerful than memorizing and coaching is the key
Hands-on experiences and practical application of knowledge are more impactful than rote memorization. **Coaching and mentorship provide guidance, feedback, and support**, making the learning process more dynamic and effective.
