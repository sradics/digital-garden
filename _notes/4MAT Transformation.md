When Knowledge Transfer Fails: The Missing Puzzle Piece

I failed at knowledge transfer for 12 years

â†’ The framework 90% of Agile coaches are overlooking

As an Agile Coach, I repeatedly faced the same frustrating challenge:

How to effectively transfer complex knowledge that actually sticks.

For example, I struggled with teaching topics like:
â€”â€”â€”
â†’ Actionable Agile Metrics for Predictability
â†’ Continuous Product Discovery Habits
â†’ Value Stream Mapping

My typical approach? Pre-learn concepts, experiment in small settings, 
then attempt to influence decision makers and teams.

The core need was always the same - design knowledge transfers where:
â€”â€”â€”
â†’ The purpose of change becomes crystal clear
â†’ Core concepts can be understood
â†’ The path to application is visible
â†’ Decisions are made

Despite my best efforts, I often failed because:
â€”â€”â€”
â†’ I went too deep in the weeds
â†’ I overlooked different learning styles
â†’ My content wasn't tailored to my audience's needs

Then came the breakthrough moment.

Last year, I discovered the missing puzzle piece: 4MAT - a comprehensive framework for designing trainings that engage all learning styles.

That "aha moment" hit me during my 4MAT design course. 
Suddenly, everything clicked.

The framework revealed my blind spots and provided a structured system for creating learning experiences that actually transform behavior.

Want to experience this transformation in your own training approach?

Join us for the first German 4MAT Mastering Training Design Workshop:
â†’ May 14-16, 2025 in Hamburg
