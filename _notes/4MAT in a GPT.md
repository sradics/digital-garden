# [[4MAT in a GPT]]
## LinkedIn Post

Can I use a GPT to design a full workshop❓  
  
Ever thought about having a GPT design your workshop?  
Recently, I created a GPT that guides me through the 4MAT's 9-step recipe to develop trainings/workshops.  
  
In the slides, you'll find an example workshop based on:  
([https://lnkd.in/ek2wYvDr](https://lnkd.in/ek2wYvDr))  
  
It's fascinating how the GPT leads me through the process.  
Even deciding at step 4 that it can proceed without my input.  
  
Here’s a quick rundown of my experience...  
  
What Works Well:  
———  
✅ Interviewing me for each step  
✅ AI-generated suggestions and summaries  
✅ Providing a potential concept and essential question  

Next to Explore:  
———  
🔄 Adding explanatory images at each step  
🔄 Ensuring my involvement throughout the process  
🔄 Fine-tuning the learning cycle diagram – can the GPT generate this?  

What do you think? Would you like to try such a GPT?

A GPT to design a full workshop❓
(following 4MAT's the 9-step recipe)

The 4MAT learning cycle also comes with a 9 step recipe to create a training/workshop. 

And I just created a first simple GPT that guides me through the 9 steps. In the slides you find a run-through with an example workshop (based on the workshop I provided 2 days ago)

Quite fascinating how GPT runs me through the steps and at step 4 decides - now it can continue without my input.

What already works well:
+ Interviewing me for the steps 
+ The AI suggestions and summary in each step
+ Providing me with a potential concept and essential question

What to explore next:
+ tuning the learning cycle diagram - let's see if I can get the diagram generated inside the GPT
+ working with explanation images in each step
+ how to still get involved with all steps

What do you think? Would you like to try such a GPT?
