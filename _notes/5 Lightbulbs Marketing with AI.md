How I supercharge my Marketing Strategy with AI and the Five Lightbulbs Method  
(💡Five💡Key💡Course💡Insights💡)  
  
I’m currently enrolled in an exceptional course based on “Simple Marketing for Smart People” by [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAADIwlUBRzxXl9jQaCOCKhUAm_B_BF8XDYg)[Billy Broas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billybroas/).  
This course integrates AI capabilities with the 5 Lightbulbs Method.  
And it’s been a game-changer for me.  
  
Here are five key insights I’ve gained so far:  
  
🔥 Insight 1: Mastering Argumentation-Based Marketing  
  
→ Understand the core of making compelling arguments  
→ Develop a strong main claim  
→ Derive supporting claims and multiple proofs  
→ Build a robust foundation for creating marketing assets  
  
🤖 Insight 2: Amplifying with AI  
  
→ AI helps challenge and refine your main claim  
→ Get suggestions for supporting claims  
→ Derive proofs for your claims  
→ Pre-write marketing assets for rapid iteration  
→ Iterate at high speed, leveraging AI’s capabilities  
  
🔍 Insight 3: Building a Strong Argumentation Base for your Business  
  
→ Derive a strong and solid argument for your product  
→ The course helps you strengthen your argument by examining it from multiple angles  
→ Engage in deep reflection and refinement to better understand your business and its core value  
  
🧠 Insight 4: Leveraging Smart Learning and Obsidian Second Brain  
My QuintSmart Learning approach is of great support for my learning during the course  
  
I already:  
→ have plenty of connected learnings  
→ created several GPTs  
→ grew a strong prompt library for all Five 💡💡💡💡💡  

→ The collaborative learning experience is incredible.  
→ We’ve learned so much already from each other. This enhances the course value a lot!  
  
Billy is opening the next cohort soon!
