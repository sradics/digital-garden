I found a way to supercharge my learning  
(my 5 main changes and 3 books with highest influence)  
  
"Your mind is for having ideas, not for holding them" - David Allen  
  
This quote was the impulse to change my approach to learning.  
  
Tired of forgetting what you learn?  
Here are 5 shifts that transformed how I retain knowledge:  
  
↳ I use AI as learning advisor  
↳ I combine focussed and diffused learning modes  
↳ For grouping and main topic entry points I grow Maps of Content  
↳ I externalize my knowledge with robust note-taking (my Second Brain)  
↳ I optimize knowledge retrieval through Capture-Organize-Distill-Express  
  
3 books that transformed my learning approach:  
‾‾‾‾‾  
📖 Learn Better by Ulrich Boser  
📖 Building a Second Brain by Tiago Forte  
📖 Learn like a Pro by Dr. Barbara Oakley and Olav Schewe
