🚀 5 Ways to Supercharge Your Thinking  
(Inspired by 📖 "The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking")  
  
1️⃣ Ground your thinking - Strive for rocked solid understanding of the BASICS  
🧪 Take 5 minutes to write down the specific components of a skill/subject fundamental to your learning.  
→ What are the fundamentals of a topic?  
→ Where do you have knowledge gaps?  
→ Can you describe the overall picture? (What is missing?)  
  
2️⃣ Ignite insights through mistakes - FAIL to succeed  
🧪 Quickly jot down ANY ideas - good, bad, inaccurate, vague  
→ Welcome accidental missteps  
→ Consider to fail nine times out of ten  
→ Exploit what's wrong and correct the errors you see  
→ Bad day? Make the conscious effort to find and extract positive lessons  
  
3️⃣ Create and ask challenging QUESTIONs - Be your own Socrates  
→ Teach to learn  
→ Improve your questions  
What is the goal❓  
What ties the ideas❓  
What are the basic examples❓  
How can I increase my curiosity❓  
How to think better and understand deeply❓  
  
4️⃣ Follow the FLOW of ideas - look back, look forward  
🧪 Quickly just do it and iterate on ideas  
→ What came before?  
→ What were they thinking?  
→ What is next - engage with an idea and add more to it  
  
5️⃣ Engaging CHANGE - Learning is a lifelong journey  
🧪 Imagine - What would a more skilled practitioner do.  
What additional knowledge, understanding and experience would they bring to the task?  
→ Be prepared to change and evolve constantly
