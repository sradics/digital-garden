## Content preparation
I just read Kieran Drews highly valuable eBook with 10 tips to make your content irresistible. But how can I make sure that I  leverage that reading? Will I remember these 39 pages? 

To make key insights from the eBook stick, I processed it through my Capture-Organize-Distill-Express flow. 

I share 5 steps to convert your eBooks to your knowledge and amplify with AI. (AND... find your little Easter Egg ðŸ¥š inside the slides)

You can CODE your knowledge this way:
âœª Capture your eBook to Read+Annotate on ReMarkable (or your eBook device)
âœª Organize the annotated version in your Second Brain. I use Obsidian.
âœª Write your Distilled Version that summarizes your Key Insights. This is your unique extraction and based on what is important for you.
âœª Express via Working Out Loud. I use my digital garden and for example this LinkedIn post. A first instance of applying my learnings. 
âœª Amplify with AI. Explore new connections, get a super distilled version. I use Smart Connections in Obsidian.

## Rule of One
Problem: Make key insights from eBooks stick
Solution: CODE and amplify AI
Story: my approach
