From 3K to 5K Followers: My 60% Growth Journey in 2.5 Months  
  
â†’ 5 Impactful Learnings about LinkedIn  
  
THANK YOU!  
â†’ for your support, guidance, time, thoughts  
  
I grew from 3k followers in July to 5k today.  
  
Looks great? But in reality I STRUGGLED.  
  
I'm at LinkedIn for about 11 years.  
Only since the beginning of 2024  
  
â‡¢ I was posting on LinkedIn daily  
â‡¢ Investing 2-3 hours per post  
â‡¢ On a wide range of topics  
  
â†’ But my growth was stagnant.  
â†’ No engagement. No comments. No likes.  
â†’ Some impressions, but with friendlier algorithm.  
  
I was in doubt. I nearly gave up.  
  
What do you do when your efforts seem futile?  
  
âž  I remembered I could learn any topic.  
  
I took LinkedIn as my challenge, MY LEARNING OPPORTUNITY.  
  
â†’ I understood the impact of engagement  
â†’ I found my focus topic and doubled down  
â†’ I learned strong formatting for skim reading  
â†’ I captured all learnings in my LinkedIn Second Brain  
  
EVERY. SINGLE. DAY  
  
âž  I brought back my JOY in Learning  
  
And I know what helped me  
  
â†’ I asked for HELP and found YOU!  
â†’ I leverage supercharged LEARNING tools  
â†’ I apply WILLPOWER plus a GROWTH MINDSET  
  
Imagine reigniting your joy for learning too.  
Learning with Ease AND Lasting Results.
