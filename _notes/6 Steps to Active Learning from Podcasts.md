Boost your learning from podcasts and unlock new insights with these 6 easy steps…  
  
1: Handwritten notes on my reMarkable. With 1.5x speed.  
2: Digitize with ChatGPT's image-to-text converter turns scribbles into searchable text in a snap.  
3: Add to my Second Brain in Obsidian, enriched with highlights.

5: Publish to my Digital Garden. Sharing is caring, and my growth is no secret. 🌐🌱  
6: Application is king. Whether it's a LinkedIn post or a project, I put my learnings to the test. (check out this post from a Podcast about Good Strategy, Bad Strategy - [https://lnkd.in/egh_Fcr8](https://lnkd.in/egh_Fcr8))

## Content preparation
Through the following 6 steps I transform from passive listening to a Podcast to actively applied knowledge.

1) I take hand written notes while listening to the Podcast (Bonus: Listen with 1.5x speed)
2) Convert notes to digital text using ChatGPT image to text converter
3) Add a new note to my Second Brain in Obsidian and take highlights - make it tangible for the next time I will use it
4) Link to existing notes in my Second Brain - reflect on the insights and wire it with existing knowledge
5) Publish the notes in my publicly available Digital Garden - write in public 
6) Express my knowledge e.g. in Form of a LinkedIn post - a first application of my new learnings
