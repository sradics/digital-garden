## Content preparation
Inspired by Lara Acosta's top 5 book recommendations - https://www.linkedin.com/posts/laraacostar_i-read-52-books-in-52-weeks-but-these-5-ugcPost-7177718061536284672-Mqm7?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop. 

That helped her hit $100k/mo < 2 years.

Short on time? I created a Blinkist Space with key insights from these books. Explore it for free:
+ Influence by Robert Cialdini
+ The Compound Effect by Darren Hardy
+ How to Win Friends and Influence People
+ Nudge by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein
+ Steal Like an Artist by Austin Kleon
+ The Happiness Hypothesis by Jonathan Haidt

My favorite - The Compound Effect! What is yours?
