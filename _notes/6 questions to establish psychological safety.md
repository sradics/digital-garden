+ What is the thing you see me doing that is helping **me to best contribute** to the team?
+ What is the **thing I do that is detracting** from our success?
+ What is one thing I need to **know about you** that will improve our relationship?
+ What is one thing **you need from me** that will enable you to be successful?
+ What is one **gift/skill/talent** you have that I **overlooked/under-valued/under-utilized**?
+ **What motivates you** and how can we bring more of that to your work?
