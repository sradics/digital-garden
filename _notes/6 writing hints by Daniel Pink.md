[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6om9ndA8dyc)

## 1) Show up every day

- even when you don't want -- this is where the best things happen
- momentum matters
- treat writing as a job
- **==consistency beats intensity==**

## 2) Give yourself a word count

- **==500 words minimum, every day==**
- get that done and do neverything else
- his books are about 70k words

## 3) Move

- **activate your body** to unlock your thoughts
- use the diffuse mode of thinking

- movement clears your mind
- thinking at 3 miles per hour

## 4) Hear your words

- reading lives in the ear
- it confronts with what is actually there
- to yourself, to a voice recorder

## 5) Writing is also social

- What promise am I making to the reader
- Their reading time is a huge responsibility
- While you are in the writing process talk to others

## 6) Figure out your process
