## Content preparation

Hook:

+ I can share my thoughts fast with you
+ This motivates discussions in a solid ground instead of artificial high level without a common understanding
+ I enable serendipity through random connecting with others
+ It creates a feedback loop, for myself just by the sheer fact that I'm writing, but also from readers
+ Connecting thoughts enables learning
+ My digital garden is a shareable copy of my ideas and my way to contribute to the growth of our collective intelligence. It is my small footprint and a way of giving back, sharing the privilege of learning.
+ Learn something on the long run
+ Express thoughts deepens learning as I need to think further about what I'm publishing. I think more about linkings thoughts, about phrasing is in an understandable way
+ my garden is a collection of evolving ideas
+ it contains thoughts in different stages of maturity. I share early on, so that others can pick it up fast
+ it is a contextual knowledge space
+ you better remember information when you create your own version of it

thanks for your inspiration Anne-Laure Le Cunff and Maggie Appleton

+ I'm not yet there with the design and usability of my digital garden. So I wonder, what would help you to better leverage this knowledge?
