9 weeks to master what took me 4 years to discover.  
  
â†’ I've built the blueprint. You get the results.  
  
For our 9 weeks - Learning Ecosystem Mastery ,  
I've chosen Circle as our live course and community platform.  
  
This powerful environment has helped me learn in several transformative communities:  
â†’ NessLabs - the first community I joined and showed me so much about the power of online communities.  
(Thanks [Anne-Laure Le Cunff, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neuranne/))  
  
â†’ The Five Lightbulbs  
where I discovered how to make compelling arguments (and I still have to practice a lot)  
(Thanks [Billy Broas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billybroas/))  
  
â†’ Linking Your Thinking  
Where MAKING notes reshaped my entire approach  
(Thanks Nick Milo)  
  
â†’ Building a Second Brain  
That initiated my knowledge management journey.  
(Thanks Tiago Forte)  
  
Now l'm genuinely excited to guide our first group of Mind Architects in building systems that turn information overwhelm into their competitive advantage.  
  
Onboarding is open. Just 7 days left to join this inaugural cohort - after that, you'll wait at least 9 more weeks.  
  
P.S. Get a preview at this week's free event:Â Behind the Scenes - My AI Workflow with Langdock - [https://lnkd.in/e_ykQ_87](https://lnkd.in/e_ykQ_87) .  
  
See the powerful connection between AI and a Second Brain in action.
