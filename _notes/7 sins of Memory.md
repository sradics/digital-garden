The 7 Sins of Memory  
(How my Second Brain enhances my Memory)  
  
Memory is a tricky thing.  
Daniel L. Schacter's 📖 "The Seven Sins of Memory" highlights how our brains can lead us astray.  
  
But what if we could counter these with a Second Brain?  
  
  
Some ideas:  
to Adress Failures to Recall  
———  
1️⃣ Transience: The decreasing accessibility of memory over time.  
🧠 Retain through notes: Capture ideas and link them in your journal.  
🧠 Spaced repetition: Implement spaced repetition systems in your Second Brain.  
  
2️⃣ Absent-mindedness: Lapses of attention that result in forgetting, often due to distractions.  
🧠 Task management tools: Use Todoist to stay on track.  
🧠 Routine checklists: Create daily checklists for important tasks.  
  
3️⃣ Blocking: The temporary inability to retrieve a memory.  
🧠 Create associations: Take notes about people to remember names better.  
🧠 Mindmaps: Use tools like Excalidraw to visualize connections.  
  
to work with Distorted or Unwanted Memories  
———  
4️⃣ Misattribution: Assigning a memory to the wrong source.  
🧠 Journaling: Connect events with context to re-access information.  
🧠 Source attribution: Always note where information comes from.  
  
5️⃣ Suggestibility: Incorporating misinformation due to leading questions or other influences.  
🧠 Reflect and verify: Take time to reflect on and verify information.  
🧠 Critical thinking prompts: Use Socratic questions to challenge your thoughts.  
🧠 Diverse perspectives: Seek and document multiple viewpoints.  
  
6️⃣ Consistency Bias: The distorting influence of current beliefs on past memories.  
🧠 Reflect on core beliefs: Regularly revisit and document your beliefs. Your Second Brain can help you access previous thought patterns even with new information.  
  
7️⃣ Persistence: The unwanted recurrence of distressing memories.  
🧠 Emotional brainwriting: Process your thoughts through brainwriting  
(check out my post on this: Unleashing Creativity with Brainwriting - [https://lnkd.in/euytZJvg](https://lnkd.in/euytZJvg)).  
  
With your Second Brain you can enhance your recall, reduce errors, and manage unwanted thoughts.

📖 [The Seven Sins of Memory](https://www.blinkist.com/en/nc/reader/the-seven-sins-of-memory-en)

Sins of Omission (Failures to Recall)
 → Transience: The decreasing accessibility of memory over time.
 🧠 Retain through notes and connecting notes with each other and a journal
 🧠 Implement spaced repetition systems within your Second Brain
 
 → Absent-mindedness: Lapses of attention that result in forgetting. Occurs when we are distracted or not paying close attention to the task at hand
 🧠 Utilize task management tools like Todoist
 🧠  Routine Checklists: Create checklists for daily routines and important tasks
 
 → Blocking: The temporary inability to retrieve a memory.
🧠 Create more associations for information susceptible to blocking. Eg. take a note about a person to remember their names better.
🧠 Create Mindmaps e.g. with Excalidraw

Sins of Commission (Distorted or Unwanted Memories)
 → Misattribution: Assigning a memory to the wrong source. This includes errors such as remembering something that happened to someone else as happening to you or confusing the context in which a memory occurred.
 🧠 Through journalling and connecting with events and context one can easily re-access information
🧠 Source Attribution: Always note the source of information

 → Suggestibility: The incorporation of misinformation into memory due to leading questions, deception, or other influences.
 🧠 Take time to reflect on information. Check the sources. Zoom out and reflect.
 🧠 Critical Thinking Prompts: Use prompts and questions - e.g. with Socratic questions
 🧠 Diverse Perspectives: Actively seek out and document multiple perspectives

 → Bias: The distorting influences of present knowledge, beliefs, and feelings on the recollection of previous experiences. This can cause memories to be reshaped in light of current beliefs and attitudes.
🧠 I regularly reflect on my core beliefs. My Second Brain represents a snapshot of knowledge. And with new information I can still access my previous way to think about it.

 → Persistence: The unwanted recurrence of memories, often disturbing or traumatic ones, that we would prefer to forget.
🧠 I work with emotional brainwriting and processing my thoughts (see https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_unleashing-creativity-with-brainwriting-activity-7167080721528913920-q_GV?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

📖 The Seven Sins of Memory by Daniel L. Schacter

--
+ Memories are transient – many memories disappear over time without us realizing it
	+ memory tricks called mnemonics, which work by linking new information to places or numbers
	+ associate new information to concepts and images that are already meaningful to you
+ absent-mindedness is an entirely different kind of memory failure
	+ Absent-mindedness means you’re not paying enough attention to the task at hand, so incoming information is either partially encoded or not at all.
	+ set up an appropriate cue that both informs and is available.
	+ Putting your medication by your toothbrush is a perfect example of an appropriate cue
+ you do know the answer – the only issue is that it’s being blocked
	+ make more associations for information susceptible to blocking
+ Misattribute things we’ve seen in different situations
	+ If information is not firmly linked to a time or place, it gets mixed up with other loose memories.
+ we are highly suggestible when it comes to remembering past events
	+ Being asked leading questions about past memories can actually change what we remember
+ consistency bias
	+ you’re likely to believe your views are the same now as they were in the past.
+ memory persistence
	+ Persistent memories are the result of events that have a big emotional impact
	+ talking or writing about persistent memories, which puts stressful experiences into a narrative context, helps us cope with them. Positive effects also include improved mood and a boosted immune system.
