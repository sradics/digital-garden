From 2.5k to 8k followers:  
  
â†’ My data behind authentic growth  
  
From 2.5k to 8k+ Followers â†’ A matter of StyleÂ described how I apply the 4 learning styles on my LinkedIn journey (details: [https://lnkd.in/ee5juTub](https://lnkd.in/ee5juTub))  
  
Today, let's feed the WHAT Learners' analytical craving with data.  
  
The Reality Check:  
â†’ Yes, my impressions have stalled  
â†’ Yes, it needs mental reprogramming to stay motivated  
  
But here's what the numbers reveal:  
â†’ 7 out of my top 10 posts are from recent months  
â†’ 8 out of top 20 posts focus on my core mission:  
helping you learn how to learn with impact and ease  
â†’ Bonus insight: LinkedIn-focused content performs strongly too (4/20 in top range)  

Interpretation:  
While overall impressions may not match last year's peaks, authentic storytelling and staying true to my core topic still creates meaningful impact.  
  
What's Working:  
â†’ Stable approach to connections (75% acceptance rate)  
  
My next bigger learning path is to better engage, contact and explore opportunities together.  
  
I found an approach for my commenting and engagement  
â†’ Active presence in the 1st hour after posting  
â†’ Early morning batch engagement  
  
Learning from combined comments to shape future content  
  
Thank you for being part of this journey. It's a joy to learn and grow together.
