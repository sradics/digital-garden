9 Tips how I learn in Sync with my Brain ðŸ§   
  
I regularly refine my approach to learning because learning tools and knowledge are constantly changing.  
  
Here's what works for me:  
â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾  
â†³ Curiosity is key!  
â†³ Find or create patterns.  
â†³ Balance focus with breaks.  
  
â†³ Use visuals or create my own.  
â†³ Connect learning with emotions.  
â†³ Group knowledge for easy recall.  
  
â†³ Take time for deeper understanding.  
â†³ Challenge myself, but avoid overwhelm.  
â†³ Link new knowledge to what I already know.  
  
Small tip: Next time you learn, embed a 15-minute mind wandering break.  
Remove any distractions and just relax or do a light exercise.  
Watch how new thoughts for your learning evolve.

## Content preparation

I consider 9 aspects for improving my daily learning
(supported by my Second Brain approach)

I learn a lot, but I also have to regularly reflect on my approach to learning, because our tools and knowledge about learning evolve fast. 

While studying many sources about Learning How to Learn I found 9 points that increase our learning capabilities.

9 points for optimal brain connectivity :
- I link the material to be learned with something I already know
- I look for connecting the learning content with emotions
- I look for patterns or create them
- I cluster knowledge to areas or groups to provide an easy to access anchor to it
- I learn in a zone where I probably will be successful - with stretching my comfort zone
- I take time until I really understand something to avoid the illusion of competence
- I work with images, best by creating my own visualizations
- I look for what is new and makes me curious
- I switch between phases with high focus and breaks to leverage the mode of focussed and diffused learning

What works best for you when you have to learning something?
