Starting a business is overwhelming.

â†’ But does it have to be chaotic?

I am building my business. 
I am overwhelmed. 
I need clarity.

It is a huge learning journey  

â†’ Understanding problems, finding solutions
â†’ Learning about Sales & Marketing
â†’ Self-management, self-care
â†’ Administrative tasks
â†’ Networking
â†’ ...

It's a lot!

â†’ I work with clients. 
â†’ I build my product.  
â†’ I conduct interviews. 
â†’ I learn from entrepreneurs.  
â†’ I immerse myself in communities. 
â†’ I take courses on LinkedIn strategies. 

One can easily end up in chaos.

Starting many things, finishing nothing. 

Consuming much, retaining little.

I decided to welcome Chaos, but Organize too.
Therefore:

â†’ All learning streams are projects
â†’ I invest in mental and physical fitness
â†’ I learn from communities and my network  
â†’ I master information with my Second Brain  

â‡¢ You can connect the dots.
â‡¢ You can recall your learnings.
â‡¢ You finish and retain. You drive.

9 days left to my virtual MASTERCLASS 
â‡¢ where I help you LEARN HOW TO LEARN, retain and recall with ease
