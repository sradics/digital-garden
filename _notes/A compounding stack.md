How I create a knowledge flywheel that pays dividends

â†’ I shouldn't be telling you this, but...

I'd like to share an example of one knowledge flywheel that I use.  

I use it for designing, marketing, and learning about my next workshop, building on many different areas of expertise:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ My knowledge about how to make an argument  
(based on the Five Lightbulbs Marketing framework by Billy Broas)  

â†’ My AI relationship briefing to provide a communication baseline  
(based on a 15,000-word conversation with AI)  

â†’ Access to all my writings to learn about writing style and topics  
(based on 400+ LinkedIn Posts and 3 months of writing my Newsletter)  

â†’ Detailed briefing about my workshop: Learning That Pays Dividends  

All integrated into an AI assistant that:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Crafts compelling LinkedIn Posts  
â†’ Designs engaging newsletters  
â†’ Refines workshop content  
â†’ Creates landing pages  

This integration supercharges my workflow.  
Now imagine the speed you gain by:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ AI supercharging YOUR expertise  
â†’ Starting AI conversations at an advanced level  
â†’ Instantly accessing months of accumulated insights  

Want a system that helps you compound knowledge too?  

Join my free "Learning That Pays Dividends" workshop  
(Wed, 26th. Limited to 30)
