Their knowledge is trapped  
  
â†’ Yours can be free  
  
Imagine having your own personal (Second) Brain expert available 24/7, ready to guide you through organizing that article you just read or that insight from yesterday's meeting  
  
I've built a simple assistant with Langdock that does exactly this. When asked, it can:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Explain the C-O-D-E methodology  
(Capture-Organize-Distill-Express)  
  
â†’ Detail the P-A-R-A framework  
(Projects-Areas-Resources-Archive)  
  
â†’ Work with your favorite problems and suggest how they fit into your PARA system  
  
â†’ Help determine the optimal location for new information  

The learning behind this? Like you, I've invested countless hours learning about Second Brain methodologies, only to have that knowledge sit dormant.  
  
With assistants like this, your knowledge becomes practical, not just theoretical.  
  
Your static information becomes active utility.  
You start applying rather than waiting.  
  
You can build your own assistants with these 3 simple steps:  
â€”â€”â€”  
1) Externalize your insights  
(e.g. from years of Second Brain practice)  
  
2) Feed this knowledge into an AI assistant  
(e.g. with [Langdock](https://www.linkedin.com/company/langdock/))  
  
3) Create conversation starters that make your knowledge immediately useful  
  
This approach saves you hours of re-learning the same concepts and makes your knowledge immediately useful.  

What knowledge could you turn into an assistant to serve you (and others)?
