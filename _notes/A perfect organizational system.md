# A perfect organizational system
## A perfect organizational system
- **universal**, encompassing any conceivable kind of information from any source
- **flexible**, able to work with any project or activity you take on, now and in the future
- **simple**, not requiring any time-consuming maintenance, cataloguing, tagging, or reorganizing beyond a bare minimum
- **actionable**, integrating seamlessly with task management and project management methods
- **cross-platform**, able to be used with any application, now existing or yet to be developed
- **outcome-oriented**, structuring information in a way that supports the delivery of valuable work
- **modular**, allowing different levels of detail to be hidden or revealed, depending on the needs of the current task
- **opportunistic**, in the good sense, taking advantage of work already being performed, instead of requiring dedicated overhead time
