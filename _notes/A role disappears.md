Agile Coach - from highest payed role

â†’ to being redundant soon
â†’ 3 years ago I did not see that coming
â†’ then several events showed me the path

I started my career as a software developer.

In 2009, 
driven by a desire to 
create better outcomes for customers 
and form great teams,
I took on the role of an Agile Coach.

The Agile Coach role gained traction:

â†’ Teams performed better
â†’ We got closer to the costumer needs
â†’ Agility changed the world
â†’ But Agile became commercialized
â†’ And rarely reached a whole-company level

The turning point came when:

My former leader told me about 2 years ago
"I asked ChatGPT about team recommendations ..."

It hit me like an epiphany. 

The Agile Coach role will DISAPPEAR:

â†’ Team Managers now incorporate Agile Thinking
â†’ AI is a strong alternative to Agile Coaching
â†’ Companies are under financial pressure
â†’ Technology and approaches evolved

It is TIME TO LEARN and add new skills:

â†’ Become AI proficient; help teams self-serve
â†’ Explore new sectors with related skills
â†’ Examine Product Discovery habits.

ANTICIPATE, don't wait.
