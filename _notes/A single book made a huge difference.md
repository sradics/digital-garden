Can a book change your life?

â†’ IT CHANGED MINE!
â†’ How I transformed struggle into success
When I finished university, my new job felt impossible. 
Demands were high, and I felt lost. 
Then I found a book.
Back than in a library. 
Online Search, Bookstores did not yet exists.
The book set me on a lifelong journey.

This book taught me: SUCCESS HAS A METHOD!
âž  through hard work and continuous learning
âž   you can outsmart talent.

From there on:

â†’ I dedicated time to learning each day
â†’ I went the extra mile. Again and again.
â†’ I preferred learning, while others chilled.

âž âž  Effort and structured learning pay off.

the right mindset and dedication,
you can achieve great things.

âž  I took highest paid IC roles
âž  I worked through 9 different roles 
âž  I lead several high performing teams

SUCCESS HAS A METHOD!
â†’ Keep learning
â†’ Keep pushing
âž  and youâ€™ll see the rWhat ONE book or resource influenced your life?
