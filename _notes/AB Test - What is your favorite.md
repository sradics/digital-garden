You have joined an A/B test  
  
â†’ Did you notice a difference?  
  
Do you remember this headline:  
"Starting a business is overwhelming.  
â†’ But does it have to be chaotic?"  
  
I conducted an experiment with different content arrangements:  
two posts, same headline, same picture, different body.  
  
You are my most competent decision-makers,  
and I want to ask for your direct opinion.  
  
Do you prefer Version 1:  
â€”â€”â€”  
[https://lnkd.in/epvaewtE](https://lnkd.in/epvaewtE)  
  
â†’ shorter  
â†’ longer sentences  
â†’ Flow from Problem - Outcome - Solution - CTA  

Or Version 2:  
â€”â€”â€”  
[https://lnkd.in/em5xfEeX](https://lnkd.in/em5xfEeX)  
  
â†’ longer  
â†’ shorter sentences  
â†’ Flow from Problem - Solution - Outcome - CTA  

Which version is your favorite? (And why?)
