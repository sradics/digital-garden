My LinkedIn A/B Test result suggests a twist  
  
â†’ 2 posts, one wins ... skimmability?  
  
In [https://lnkd.in/eDu4857z](https://lnkd.in/eDu4857z) I asked for your opinion on  
  
â†’Version 1: [https://lnkd.in/eWdmMpwg](https://lnkd.in/eWdmMpwg) OR  
  
â†’Version 2: [https://lnkd.in/ee9Xa6CF](https://lnkd.in/ee9Xa6CF)  
  
â€”â€”â€” Version 1 results â€”â€”â€”  
  
Version 1 was a remake, with the Five Lightbulbs Marketing approach applied.  
Flow: Problem-Outcome-Solution  
(details about the Five Lightbulbs approach: [https://lnkd.in/eqCNkQCz](https://lnkd.in/eqCNkQCz))  
  
Version 1 got:  
â‡¢ 122 Comments  
â‡¢ 736 impressions  
â‡¢ 70 likes  
  
35% preferred this option (12 votes)  
  
I distilled the following reasoning:  
â†’ more engaging  
â†’ more compelling  
â†’ more in depth (2x)  
â†’ better believe building  
â†’ less distracting, better flow (6x)  
â†’ better with examples and insights  

And it got 5 lead comments!  
Commenters I can follow up with to invite to my Masterclass.  
  
â€”â€”â€” Version 2 results â€”â€”â€”  
  
Version 2 was optimized for skimmability  
Flow: Problem-Solution-Outcome  
  
Version 2 got:  
â‡¢ 110 Comments  
â‡¢ 1071 impressions  
â‡¢ 78 likes  
  
65% preferred this option (23 votes)  
  
It got 2 lead comments!  
  
I distilled the following reasoning:  
â†’ flow better  
â†’ skimmable (17x)  
â†’ direct and engaging  
â†’ build emotions  
â†’ more personal  
  
â€”â€”â€” Conclusion â€”â€”â€”  
The results are an interesting mixed bag.  
From engagement stats, there is not a clear winner.  
Regarding impressions, there might be LinkedIn algorithm changes at play.  
  
However, the Five Lightbulb version received 5 lead comments  
vs. 2 lead comments for Version 2.  
  
This is an important outcome.  
  
Interestingly, comments also suggested a solution.  
  
âž  Combine the flow of version 1: Problem-Outcome-Solution  
with the skimmability of version 2.  
  
My main take-aways:  
â€”â€”â€”  
âž  Make the content easy to read, fast to skim  
âž  More depth with examples makes it more compelling  
âž  Problem - Outcome - Solution might convert better  
(Only a slight signal! Need to test that more)  

What is ONE thought you have right now?
