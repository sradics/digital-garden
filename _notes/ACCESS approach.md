# ACCESS approach
An interesting mapping of tools in the areas *folders vs links* and *knowledge vs action*
(A)tlas -(C)alendar - (C)ards - (E)xtra- (S)ources - (S)paces

ACCESS reflects the knowledge part. [[#Spaces]] with MAPS cover the action part.

Provides a top/down view.

with Sub-structures - (M)ocs - (A)reas - (P)rojects - (S)upporting Notes
In the MAPS the action happens.

# Reflection to PARA
+ I like the ATLAS and Calendar entry points. Although:
	+ ATLAS is currently covered by META folders
	+ Calendar is currently covered by Journal folders but I like the sub-categories for it (like Daily, Plan, Reviw...) .. can make a great folder insights projects
+ I need to start using MOCs more to gain an overview and link things more together. The MOCs then build the central entry points to cross connect information.
+ Extra - is covered by Resources or Meta (and sub folders connected) ...here I still need to further optimize and create clarity.
+ SPACES are covered by projects ... and currently work better for me
