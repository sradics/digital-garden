# AI Agents

An agent is a system that is designed to perceive its environment, make decisions and take actions to achieve a specific goal or set of goals. Once given its goal or set of goals, the agent operates autonomously, meaning it is not directly controlled by a person.

we can get AI to figure out how to prompt itself to achieve the task

allow language models to connect to tools, other models and itself, giving it the ability to interact with the outside world through these connections to achieve the specified task. AutoGPT, HuggingGPT, Toolformer, ChatGPT Plugins and more are all examples of this

Auto-prompting is an AI system's ability to break down a complex goal into its own set of tasks and sub-prompts.
