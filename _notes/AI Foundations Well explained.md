I should travel more by train, says my brain  
  
â†’ after I read this AI book, clear and plain  
â†’ FIVE ROLES FOR AI worth to explain  
  
ðŸ“– Co-Intelligence:  
Living and Working with AI  
by [Ethan Mollick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emollick/)  
  
What a fascinating journey in the AI world!  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
FIVE ROLES FOR AI  
â€”â€”â€”  
 AI as a PERSON  
â†’ tell it to act like a particular person  
  
ðŸ¤– â€” Persona briefing example  
"You are an expert at marketing. When asked to generate slogan ideas you come up with ideas that are different from each other, clever, and interesting. You use clever wordplay..."  
â€” ðŸ¤–  
  
  
2) AI as CREATIVE  
"LLM are connection machines. They are trained by generating relationships between tokens that may seem unrelated to humans..."  
AI adds randomness too  
â†’ a powerful setup for innovation  
â†’ my post on Switch Writing connects well too  
[https://lnkd.in/eZWTXtFc](https://lnkd.in/eZWTXtFc)  
  
"... GPT-4 outperformed all but 9.4 percent of humans tested in generating CREATIVE IDEAS"  
  
  
3) AI as COWORKER  
â†’ Most our jobs will overlap with AI capabilities  
(Only 36 job categories out of 1016 had no overlap)  
  
â†’ categorize Tasks and invite AI  
â†³ Just Me TasksÂ Â Â Â -- no AI  
â†³ Delegated TasksÂ Â -- some AI  
â†³ Automated TasksÂ -- full AI  
 AI as a TUTOR  
â†’ AI enhances learning and reduces busywork  
  
"... that the average student tutored one-to-one performed two standard deviations better than students educated in a conventional classroom environment..."  
  
"With AI tutors taking care of some of the content delivery outside of class, teachers can devote more time to fostering meaningful interactions with their students during class."  

5) AI as a COACH  
highlight areas for improvement  
â†’ asking for reflections  
â†’ there for a dialog
