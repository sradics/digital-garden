# AI in Obsidian
Recently I unlocked new possibilities with Text Generator in my Obsidian Second Brain 🧠 - it's a great addition! rephrase: Now I can super easy  get what I want

Now I can easily obtain what I want.:

⭐️ ask for further ideas 💡
⭐️ rephrase notes in a shorter and improved version 
⭐️ improve my headlines to better find and reconnect with my notes

This direct integration within Obsidian makes it super easy to leverage OpenAI for developing a topic. Mark a sentence or take the full note, hit "Generate Text" and the results is embedded in your note.
