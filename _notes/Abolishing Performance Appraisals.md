The employee freely decides if and when to initiate and gather feedback from various sources. When collected, the results are sent only to the rated employee (or, sometimes, 360-degree models utilize a processing center that deletes the identity of contributors but makes no record of the feedback).

her many contributions in keeping the benefit functions humming. Kathleen then artfully delves into the first of three areas where she feels Julia could make some improvement. Julia’s response is denial and defense. On the next issue, Julia again puts up a wall, challenging Kathleen’s observations and viewpoint. Kathleen, feeling frustrated, takes a deep breath, and then starts to give feedback on the last area for improvement. Before she even finishes, Julia cuts her off with “But this…” and “But that…” In total exasperation, Kathleen stops and says,”What do you want from me? Yo u asked for some honest feedback. I spent two half days looking over your work, thinking of where you could grow.Today, I’m just trying to honestly tell you what I think and what could go better.You ‘ve done nothing but shut me down, telling me I’ve got it wrong and why the improvement isn’t necessary.” Julia looked stunned and didn’t respond. 27 After an eternity of silence, Kathleen finished her last point and Julia said nothing. Kathleen nervously covered development goals while Julia passively nodded. Julia signed the review, and it was sent on to her personnel file. Julia’s pay raise was as good as anyone’s in the department. In the days following the review, it was clear that the relationship had taken a big step downhill. Kathleen gazed out the window, asking herself,”Why did my best efforts to help Julia and give her the feedback she expressly asked for end in such disaster?” Some would say Julia needs an attitude change. Others would say Kathleen must become more artful. What is seldom asked is—How did the context of the formal process of appraisal affect their conversation?

We see the new model as a confluence of these ideas: An organization, because it is a system, cannot be significantly improved by focusing on individuals. The choices of commitment and responsibility must be left to individuals if they are to be meaningful and effective. Less structure and control over the individual employee often will result in greater motivation and productivity. Employees cannot be motivated to perform their best, but conditions of openness and trust can unleash intrinsic motivation, spirit, and heart-felt commitment to organization goals. Focus on improving the overall “system” of the organization yields better results than trying to get employees to improve their individual performance. Organizations can survive and grow only if they are freely evolving systems, where variation, differentiation, and diversity are valued as pathways to innovation and improvement. — location: [822](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005LY2FPS&location=822) ^ref-52810

Cindy asks,”What do I need to do to get a 4?” Muriel tells her,”A rating of 3 represents good work—nobody should get a 4 unless they’re doing something truly extraordinary. And that’s not likely to happen. If you’re only doing your job well, you’re merely doing what’s expected and that is a 3 rating.” Cindy finds out that everyone in her department got 3s. Cindy nonetheless was discouraged because she really wanted to excel, but Muriel seemed to suggest that a brick wall was in the way. Cindy later learns that supervisors in other departments, who went to the same appraisal training as did Muriel, had given 4s to many people.When confronted about this by her staff, Muriel steadfastly stuck to her position that 3 is the appropriate grade for people who perform their jobs well.”Exceeds means exceeds,” she explained.

When you pop popcorn, the kernels pop at different times. This does not mean you have lazy kernels or a derelict microwave. Some don’t pop at all. The size, the shape, the density, the genetic structure of the kernels may contribute to this variation, as may the storage temperature, the room temperature where the microwave is located, how the microwaves are beamed, the wattage, and whether the microwave has a rotating platter. Whether the bag is placed precisely in the center or slightly off center will have an effect, as will the placement of the kernels within the bag. We could go on, but what we are illustrating is that the causes of variation has infinitesimal dimensions, most of which can never be solved.

Peter Block’s Observations on Appraisal Performance appraisals are an instrument for social control.They are annual discussions, avoided more often than held, in which one adult identifies for another adult three improvement areas to work on over the next twelve months.You can soften them all you want, call them development discussions, have them on a regular basis, have the subordinate identify the improvement areas instead of the boss, and discuss values. None of this changes the basic transaction.… If the intent of appraisal is learning, it is not going to happen when the context of the dialogue is evaluation and judgment. — location: [1428](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005LY2FPS&location=1428) ^ref-15182

A goal by itself does not tell a person what to do. If the supervisor merely gives the employee a higher target, without insights, explanation, or exploration of new methods, in effect that tells the employee that the supervisor thinks he’s been goofing off. Otherwise the goals would already have been attained. Instead of pronouncing goals, the supervisor must take time to understand the origin of a performance deficiency. Is it a lack of skill or training? Is the employee uninterested or unmotivated?

Rather than reassuring people of their worth, praise is in effect a form of gaining status over another person.The giving of praise implies one is in a position to sit in judgment.This sometimes makes a person feel diminished. When people are conditioned to look for praise in their work, it constricts rather than encourages creativity because the employee is focused on praise rather than the task. Similarly, praise is an easy out that can discourage supervisors from getting involved in people’s work, its problems, and possibilities. — location: [2292](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005LY2FPS&location=2292) ^ref-20680

Praise is associated with criticism because so often it’s used to sugarcoat blame or be a part of the “sandwich” technique, in which harsh criticism is preceded and followed by praise. Rather than bridging people, praise sometimes puts distance between people. (“See for yourself,” Dr. Farson says,”if praise doesn’t tend to hold off, to separate, while other behaviors—like listening—tend to include, to embrace.” ) Praise tends to terminate rather than encourage communication. In human communication, an evaluative statement in a conversation usually means it has ended (e.g.,”You ‘re doing fine. Keep up the good work” and people go back to what they were doing).6 — location: [2296](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005LY2FPS&location=2296) ^ref-49837

Throw that one away along with what you’ve been doing, and start over on this one. Sorry about that,” and the boss walks out. What is your reaction?

Use well-defined criteria and collaborative input and assessment to contain some of the bias and distortion that you will experience. If you believe that merit differentials must be awarded to a larger degree than a small fraction of the workforce, at least refrain from using wholesale merit pay. Don’t label COLA and market adjustments as merit. Merit should be reserved for distinguishing contributions against specified criteria. Whatever process you use to assess or rate merit, detach it from all other functions, including coaching, feedback, employee development counseling, and promotion decisions. Contrary to commonly conveyed Skinnerian advice, do everything you can to get merit pay out of the minds of your employees as they do their day-to-day work. Don’t fall into the trap of believing you will necessarily get fairer merit pay decisions by measuring people against established performance goals. As discussed earlier, goal-based incentives are nonetheless fraught with rating errors and damaging side effects. — location: [3071](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005LY2FPS&location=3071) ^ref-57078

---
Do the people in our organization seem satisfied with our current appraisal process? Is there a particular aspect that causes the most dissatisfaction or renders our appraisal process ineffective? Or are people just indifferent and underwhelmed? Has our organization gone through umpteen revisions of the appraisal process and forms? Do people in our organization gladly participate in the process? Or do we see procrastination and prolific prodding to get supervisors and employees to participate? Are there indicators of dissatisfaction from data our organization has collected from sources such as employee attitude surveys, exit interviews, feedback gathered on our appraisal system, grievances or complaints filed with H.R. or EEO offices? When appraisals are spoken about at lunch, in the break room, or by the water cooler, do people indicate respect, enthusiasm, and appreciation for the process? Or do we hear sarcasm, fear, indifference, or putting down the process? In the day-to-day work environment throughout the year, do the people in our organization pay attention to the goals, personal development, and other links to our appraisal process? Or do people seem connected to these links only during the few weeks before and after the appraisal process? — location: [4402](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005LY2FPS&location=4402) ^ref-54105

Step 11: Go back to the top leadership. To avoid an untimely veto later, revisit top executives and review the scope of your intended design to get their blessing on the final course corrections. Step 12: Complete the design and devise an implementation strategy. Make your design model specific and create the necessary tools, processes, and procedures needed for implementation. Clearly define the roles for employees, managers, and the H.R. department. Decide on a time line and determine the necessary financial, staffing, and expert resources. Step 13: Plan a pilot run. Ascertain the benefits of a trial run on a small scale, analyze results, and make needed adjustments to your design and implementation strategy. Step 14: Present the final design and secure approval from top leadership. Advise and get the organization’s top leadership team’s okay on the final design.

Decouple appraisal from other processes (pay, promotions, discipline, etc.). Disconnecting appraisal from pay will reap many benefits, especially in improving the reception of feedback and development suggestions. If pay is disconnected, try to conduct appraisals at a different time of the year from when pay raises are granted. Disconnecting appraisal from discipline will reduce fear. Make the process a collaborative task, shifting responsibilities to the employee as much as possible. Employee selection of the feedback sources is a particularly helpful way to shift responsibility. Have the appraisal prepared by the employee and limit the supervisor’s role to input and final approval. Do not require appraisals to be placed in the personnel file—perhaps the supervisor would keep it or just the employee—legally required or prudent information can be preserved as needed. Instead of appraisal, use a mandatory, written feedback system, with no scales or connection to pay (again, not as the ultimate goal, but as a transitional process).
