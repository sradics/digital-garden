# [[About AI and the switch to becoming more of a manager]]
based on: [[About AI and the switch to becoming more of a manager]]

Core ideas:
+ Thanks to Dan Shipper for your great essay: About AI and the switch to becoming more of a manager
+ in his essay Dan provided a very interesting thought - ChatGPT as a summarizer of human knowledge
+ that frees us from the heavy time investment of summarizing and brings us to higher level topics - so AI can be seen as an **abstraction layer over lower-level thinking**.
+ This shift the focus from What you know to Knowing how to allocate resources. For instance, choosing which work has to be done, deciding on what is good enough and bringing in our creativity when it is not
+ We have to shift to become knowledge managers. This means how well can you allocate and manage knowledge resources to get work done
+ One big implication is that today's knowledge workers need to add (knowledge) management capabilities to their skill set
	+ how to allocate work to different AI models and approaches
	+ how to make sure the work gets done well working with a coherent vision of what needs to be accomplished
	+ this implies being able to articulate a concise, specific and coherent vision
	+ knowledge how to break up complex tasks and orchestrate work
	+ bringing in their intuition when to get into details and when not
+ A main conclusion: People who are better equipped to use different facets of AI in their day-to-day lives will be at a significant advantage in the economy
+ Another conclusion: Working with knowledge management approaches like Building a Second Brain and leveraging AI summarization to combine AI with my specific and unique focus and knowledge propels my capabilities to solve higher level work and create an impact


Headline teasers for phrasing a hooking headline:
+ Today's knowledge workers are urgently required to add knowledge management to their skill set
+ It is not longer about what you know but to know how to allocate and manage knowledge
