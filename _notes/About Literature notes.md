# About Literature notes
SÃ¶nke Ahrens (): 2.3 Literature Notes [[@ahrens_23_nodate]]

- Created via the Zotero plugin. 
- should contain the reference to the Author
- there is now appropriate template for a literature note

## 4 levels of complexity
You can also mix all 4 level for one literature notes

### The Mere Reference
- added directly where it belongs with a reference to the source
- the reference is super handy to later on learn where it will be used too ...
- it shows which ideas point back to this literature note

### Simple Note
- When we write more content on the literature note
- Often it is better to continue in a permanent note, especially when you start with your own thinking. Then it makes sense to reference the Literature note
- 

### Bullet Point list
+ on page x it say y ...
+ this is fast for reading and not interrupting flow
+ turn them into a permanent note later on ...
+ this becomes an accelerator for permanent notes

### The excerpt
+ best to really learn from what you read
+ to immerse yourself further
+ highlights as in between notes
+ don't just repeat the text but add your questions, express in your own words
+ helps us to detect the main arguments
+ it supports better understanding
+ learning by elaboration, by doing something with the text

## About highlighting
+ highlights still stay in the context of the authors flow
+ they are useful as an intermediate step
+ write the literature notes or permanent by the highlights
+ highlight are a bit like [[About fleeting notes]]

## Connections
- can well be linked in out output and permanent notes
- still - literature notes are mainly in the context of the authors writing
- but develop from the existing permanent notes and integrate the literature notes. This way **==you leave the literature notes context==** . You really free your mind here

## Questions
- How to best integrate Kindle highlights into a Literature reference from Zotero?
	- I guess I should them embed the Kinde highlights linked into the Literature note
