# [[About Mastery - my path with Smart Connect]]

Your notes are keeping secrets from you  
  
→ Stop searching your notes. Start conversing with them  
  
I've been observing Smart Connect for Obsidian for about a year.  
It has transformed into an AI powerhouse for my notes.  
  
Wtf$#?@  
  
Oh, I realize, I was a bit too much in the weeds.  
Let me take a step back and explain.  
  
My problem:  
———  
I maintain about 4000 notes, with about 3 Million words and 12k links.  
→ And I want to ask questions to my notes.  
→ But with normal search, the answers are quite limited.  
  
I need to remember too much of the structure.  
And it also just searches for the exact word.  
  
→ I want to find connections.  
→ I want to ask for a fast lane overview.  
→ I want to explore and have a helping hand for that  

My solution:  
———  
→ I have a tool that reads all my notes.  
→ Then converts these notes in a form, that AI can work with with.  
→ Next I can use ChatGPT to ask about my notes and work with it.  
  
A next level of compounding my insights.  
About leveraging my externalize knowledge in new ways.  
  
Wtf$#?@ - decoded:  
  
→ I use Obsidian as software of making my notes.  
→ I use the Smart Connect for Obsidian software to build that AI bridge  
→ I use ChatGPT to access my notes and work with it.  
  
One example:  
———  
I recently read the great book MASTERY by George Leonhard.  
→ my highlights from the book are about 4k words. Still quite a lot to read.  
  
And just this morning I asked:  
"Summarize the key insights from my note about Leonard-Mastery"  
  
And among many great insight Chatty did provide,  
these are the ones I want to share:  
  
———  
“The plateau can be a form of purgatory but also the space for hidden growth.”  
“To learn is to change, and the best learning involves learning how to learn.”  
———  
  
Now tell me, does continuous learning mean to be on a path to mastery?  
Are you up for the best learning?  
  
If you want to gain more insights into my AI learning setup, I'll explore that with my next newsletter edition, this Friday 13:00 CET.  
  
———  
P.S.  
I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease
