## Content preparation
I have my mind framed with growth loops and constant feedback.

I use the PARI system, a mindful productivity practice that applies mindframing and combines working with a Growth Mindset, Metacognition and Self-Authorship.

Applied to my daily push up routine:
+ with my PACT being committed to invest in my core physical strength every day
+ my ACT to have time blocked every morning to exercise, covered with my mental model of tiny steps, pushing for what is possible that day, stretching it with Goggins in mind
+ my REACT to capture daily progress and learn about plateaus, reaching new levels and looking at the development long term and accepting fluctuations in daily form
+ my IMPACT to connect my core strength to longevity, to have this strength exercise embedded on my bigger physical and mental health fitness program.

With PARI I care about winning repeatedly and building my core strength to pave my path to longevity.
