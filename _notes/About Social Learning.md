# About Social Learning

Annie Murphy Paul taught us in her fantastic book The Extended Mindâ€¦

"...the brain stores social information differently than it stores information that is non-social...we remember social information more accurately, a phenomenon that psychologists call the 'social encoding advantage."

**when people interact socially, their brains engage different neural and cognitive processes**Â than when those same people are thinking or acting on their own
