## Strategy Kernel 
Diagnosis - Guiding Policy - Coherent Action

### Diagnosis
What is going on?
   - Hypotheses of what is going on & how things are connected ... we have that problem, because ...

What is holding you back?
The Crux is the hardest part of the problem

### Guiding Policy
What are we going to do about this problem?
How will we deal with the situation
Source of power / advantage / efficiency â†’ focus that power on a target that you can affect

Most important tool: Think Again

### Coherent Action
Deal with the problem
How to break inertia 

Most important tool: Focus

## BAD STRATEGY
   - Set of wished goals
   - List of the thing you wish to happen
   - Fluff, word salad
   - Incoherent actions
   - goals are not the strategy as they leave out important aspects
