Unlock the Secret to Winning Strategies!  
(Tired of confusing strategy with tools?)  
  
It is about understanding the essence of strategy, beyond the analytical tools often mistaken for the strategy itself.  
  
The kernel of your strategy is a triad: Diagnosis, Guiding Policy, and Coherent Action.  
  
Diagnosis  
‾‾‾‾‾  
First, ask, "What's the real challenge here?" 🧐  
Craft hypotheses. Connect the dots. Understand the root cause.  
  
"We're facing this hurdle because..."  
  
Pinpoint your Crux - the toughest nut to crack that’s holding you back.  
  
Guiding Policy  
‾‾‾‾‾  
What are you going to do about this problem?  
How can you apply your Source of Power on a target that you can affect?  
  
'Think Again'. Always question, always analyze.  
  
Coherent Action  
‾‾‾‾‾  
Your plan to implement your strategy. Overcome inertia. Make those decisive moves.  
Apply laser FOCUS. Prioritize what matters.

## Strategy Kernel 
Diagnosis - Guiding Policy - Coherent Action

### Diagnosis
What is going on?
   - Hypotheses of what is going on & how things are connected ... we have that problem, because ...

What is holding you back?
The Crux is the hardest part of the problem

### Guiding Policy
What are we going to do about this problem?
How will we deal with the situation
Source of power / advantage / efficiency → focus that power on a target that you can affect

Most important tool: Think Again

### Coherent Action
Deal with the problem
How to break inertia 

Most important tool: Focus

## BAD STRATEGY
   - Set of wished goals
   - List of the thing you wish to happen
   - Fluff, word salad
   - Incoherent actions
   - goals are not the strategy as they leave out important aspects
