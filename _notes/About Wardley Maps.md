# About Wardley Maps

Wardley Maps Main entry point by Simon Wardley -Â [**https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec**](https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec)

An easy way to start mapping isÂ [**https://www.onlinewardleymaps.com**](https://www.onlinewardleymaps.com/)/

## About maps
-   Space has a meaning
-   You have an anchor (e.g. like where is north)
-   (e.g. a systems overview is not a map but a diagram)
-   â€žMapsâ€œ in business are mainly not a map but a diagram
-   Anchor: can be the customer
-   Start with the customer and create a chain of needs for that customer down to the low level system components

## Main Steps
+ The purpose - the moral comparative
+ Understand the landscape youâ€™re competing inÂ 
+ Climate patterns - so how the landscape is changing
+ Understand doctrine and principles of organization. Doctrine: universally applicable principles regardless of context .. around 40Â 
+ Manage the evolutionary flow before you manage the process flow
+ How are the users, what are there needs (components) and how evolved are these components [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsDT7L-tARs)
	+ characteristics change with evolution of components
+ a huge difference between being agile (using proper approach to stay flexible) and using agile (Kanban, Scrum, XP,...)
+ pre mortem - create a map of the current status and challenge
+ post mortem - learn what happened using the map
+ patterns
	+ climatic patterns - you can't control but are useful for predictxion
	+ doctrine - universally useful patterns
	+ gameplay - more context specific patters

### Climatic patterns
+ for anticipation where the market is going
+ everything evolves if there is supply and demand competition
	+ resulting in inertia based on past success
+ co evolution of practice
	+ so new practices develop and other get outdated (e.g. Mean Time to Recovery decreased and e.g. enabled Mircoservices to evolve; DevOps)
+ efficiency enables innovation and new areas of value will be created
+ strategy is iterative
+ 3 forces - efficiency, speed and new value

### Doctrine and Gameplay
+ you have a choice over
+ doctrine - universally useful
+ gameplay - very context specific

#### Doctrine
About 40 doctrines

[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPDVA6uVAlU)
+ **focus on who are the users**
	+ then **focus on the needs** of these users
	+ then **know the details **of these needs
	+ then **understand how evolved these components are**
+ this** establishes a common language** and you can start to challenge assumptions
+ this brings you to **using appropriate methods**

With different maps, you can then find maps common to all maps. Based on that:
* **Remove Bias and Duplication**

![[Pasted image 20240122130653.png]]

A **bias towards using data** is also a universally useful pattern. And maps provide us with data too.

#### Gameplay
About 100 different forms.
Example: Innovate - Leverage - Commoditize
+ take a product and turn into utility and expose as API
	+ enable other to build on top of that API (and they will build a lot of things of top of it)
	+ you can learn from what is useful and you can mine these ideas and derived next services from that you can build products on and later commoditize
+ so this ways others innovate for you and you gain research and development from the outside

![[Pasted image 20240122131339.png]]

Leverage ecosystem to learn about usage. Efficiency increases with the size of the ecosystem. You can innovate more.
