## About maps
-   Space has a meaning
-   You have an anchor (e.g. like where is north)
-   (e.g. a systems overview is not a map but a diagram)
-   â€žMapsâ€œ in business are mainly not a map but a diagram
-   Anchor: can be the customer
-   Start with the customer and create a chain of needs for that customer down to the low level system components

## Main Steps
+ The purpose - the moral comparative
+ Understand the landscape youâ€™re competing inÂ 
+ Climate patterns - so how the landscape is changing
+ Understand doctrine and principles of organization. Doctrine: universally applicable principles regardless of context .. around 40Â 
+ Manage the evolutionary flow before you manage the process flow
