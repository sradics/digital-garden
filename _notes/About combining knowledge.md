The secret to effective landing pages isn't design  
  
â†’ It's these 2 powerful frameworks  
  
Creating a landing page seems simple.  
  
Until you actually try to do it.  
  
â†’ Each word must earn its place  
â†’ Design either guides or confuses  
â†’ Structure makes or breaks comprehension  
  
I built a system that combines two powerful frameworks:  
  
Framework 1: Argumentation-Based Marketing  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ I read Billy Broas book Simple Marketing for Smart People  
â†’ Took the Five Lightbulbs marketing course  
â†’ Even co-created some of Billy's sessions  
  
âž  This gives me the structure to help my audience to understand  
the topic and make informed decisions  
  
Framework 2: 4MAT Learning Design:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ I took the 4MAT master training design course  
â†’ Read Teaching around the 4MAT cycle  
â†’ Developed 25+ courses  
  
âž  This gives me the knowledge to fill the landing page with relevant training details  
  
Trying to juggle all these frameworks and details in your head?  
  
Impossible.  
  
That's where my knowledge management system changes everything:  
â†’ You can access this knowledge super fast  
â†’ Extend and combine this knowledge with AI  
â†’ Every learning becomes a reusable asset, ready to deploy  
  
Instead of starting from scratch, I simply assemble proven elements from my knowledge system to create effective assets in a fraction of the time.  
  
I've just applied this exact system to create a landing page for our upcoming 4MAT Training in Hamburg.  
  
Would you take a quick look and share your thoughts?  
[https://lnkd.in/eRjkc_GF](https://lnkd.in/eRjkc_GF)  
  
I'm particularly curious:  
â†’ Does the argument flow logically?  
â†’ What questions remain unanswered?  
â†’ What would make the decision easier?  
  
In return:  
Comment or DM "compound" if you'd like to learn more about building your own knowledge system that transforms your learnings into valuable assets.
