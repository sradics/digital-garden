# About fleeting notes
SÃ¶nke Ahrens (2025): 2.2 Fleeting Notes [[@ahrens_22_2025]]


- fast jot down an idea
- all formats allowed short/long/image/video/etc...
- mainly a reminder of a thought to write about
- often a starting point of a bigger thought ...

1) Decide of it is worth creating a permanent
2) Decide where to put it

Permanent note
- add context of where the thought appeared (Remark, Relate)

It should at least contain a bit of myself - (a comment, an own take on something)

- fleeting note in the daily note
- SÃ¶nke exclude the daily notes from search ...
- flushes the mind (in the morning)
- aim for streaks of uninterrupted writing
- add a checkbox to the fleeting note if it is processed

## Processing 
- what are or project is it most relevant for
- What does this new piece of information add to new note
	- answers?
	- questions?
	- contradicts?
- deeper compare with what you already know
- add forward links already
- add backwards links - for where this new notes makes sense
- clarify the "Why" of a connection between idea
- from association to reasoning
- we translate an idea from one context to another - it is not just adding a note
- there might be several permanent notes as a result from one fleeting note
- we use previous notes as reality check

After integrating a fleeting note we might either delete it or mark it as integrated (in my system I might then move it to archive)

When you extend a permanent note and new ideas pop up, it is also completely fine to just extend the permanent note with the new question. No need to get out of flow at use fleeting notes too strict here.
