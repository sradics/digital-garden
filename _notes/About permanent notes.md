„The main goal of writing permanent notes is to build a "critical mass"“ ([Ahrens, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=1&annotation=8J7T67IG))

„while writing permanent notes: "To what question/idea/fact/train of thought adds this new piece of information something and how?”“ ([Ahrens, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=1&annotation=Y6WF737A))

„add links to your notes, ask: “**==How and in which contexts do I want to be reminded of this piece of information in the future?==**"“ ([Ahrens, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=1&annotation=2KZB4GP4))

„most new notes can be tied directly to existing ones“ ([Ahrens, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=1&annotation=VZ4XVX3W))

„eep our eye on what is most relevant for building our own Zettelkasten in digital form, which is first and foremost: Our own questions and topic choices.“ ([Ahrens, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=2&annotation=PVLZGUUL))

„they are still about how you yourself understand, interpret or contextualize data, an idea or a fact“ ([Ahrens, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=2&annotation=CJ8YSB7D))

„the quality of literature notes is measured by how well they represent what is written in someone else's writing“ ([Ahrens, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=2&annotation=HM65YECB))

„**==the quality of permanent notes is measured by how well they represent what you are thinking==**“ ([Ahrens, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=2&annotation=28RDIXEB))
- make our understanding of something as explicit as possible

„what questions you have, and to what end you write what you write“ ([Ahrens, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=2&annotation=KSNI4ZRJ))

„Try to write as if you were writing a report for someone else“ ([Ahrens, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=3&annotation=8QCCRMFQ))

„**Name the facts, disclose your sources, and try to be as precise, clear and brief as possible**“ ([Ahrens, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=3&annotation=E386FJCU))

„**write full sentences**. It helps to form a coherent thought.“ ([Ahrens, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=3&annotation=CFLAQDZH))
- ensure that what is written, really expresses what you meant

„distinguish between hypotheses, questions, and assumptions.“ ([Ahrens, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=3&annotation=86AH3MCS))

„**==most importantly: Be honest.==** This is not the place to cover up a lack of understanding by being vague, evasive, or verbose.“ ([Ahrens, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=3&annotation=6YRIUHJF))

„it should be written as if the reader will know nothing about what we meant apart from what is actually in writing“ ([Ahrens, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=3&annotation=AASR3BKI))

„Just try to find the best descriptive title with those words included, you will later most likely search for“ ([Ahrens, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=4&annotation=MS87JD7S))

„“The characteristics of permanent notes in the Zettelkasten compared to literature notes”.“ ([Ahrens, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=4&annotation=R4D4FGYN))

„But it is also crucial to stress that a note is usually written within the context of a particular line of thought, from which it gains its main relevance and meaning“ ([Ahrens, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=4&annotation=LQPQVI8S))

„making often rather the whole note-sequence the better building block of what we try to create.“ ([Ahrens, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=4&annotation=INAVQ7FB))

„we not only write “atomic notes”, but also, maybe mainly: **==“molecule notes”: bigger entities containing multiple, sometimes large numbers of individual atoms/notes.“==** ([Ahrens, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=4&annotation=DUF2LHWC))[[What are molecule notes]]

> [!todo]
> I need to understand more about the [[What are molecule notes|molecule notes]] and sequences of notes. How to split, how to link, how to keep an overview. And also - when to split, when does a thought really end?

„the most important connections between notes are actually the ones tracing a train of thought, an argument, or a consideration over multiple notes.“ ([Ahrens, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=5&annotation=JYVPZUBK))

„notes that are direct follow-ups to other notes“ ([Ahrens, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=5&annotation=JWKT74C9))

„Note sequences on the other hand do form a thought, sometimes even an argument.“ ([Ahrens, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=5&annotation=BVRV86S3))

„The best permanent notes are written in a way that they explicitly extend a thought already represented in a note-sequence.“ ([Ahrens, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=5&annotation=SPK3ZJSG))

„When we add notes explicitly in relation to others we also should phrase them accordingly.“ ([Ahrens, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=6&annotation=IMG735K7))

„any personal knowledge systems I have seen contain a lot of lists and **bullet points**, which is something we deliberately **try to avoid** here as they **lack** exactly what is most important in a Zettelkasten: the clarification of **the relationship between** two pieces of information.“ ([Ahrens, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=6&annotation=YAATBREG))

„generally it is advisable to **==use explanatory expressions like "therefore", "but", "even though", "on the other hand", "In contrast to"==** etc. whenever possible“ ([Ahrens, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=6&annotation=A6NSVAJ6))

„Another form of prompting elaboration is to turn an idea or an argument on its head by asking: how could I invert the argument? Like: What if the therapist doesn’t believe his work with a patient will be helpful?“ ([Ahrens, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=6&annotation=HT3FKTMK))

„Inverting a problem is a form of doing something with a problem instead of just reacting to it.“ ([Ahrens, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=7&annotation=IQ8XGIP2))

„While permanent notes are atomic in their nature (containing one idea, written in a way that they can stand on their own),“ ([Ahrens, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=7&annotation=42WLXXQX))

„Sometimes it makes sense to take one paragraph from one note-sequence and add it to another. But not by linking or embedding, and also not by simple copy & paste, but by rephrasing it in order to make it a better fit. I would still keep the connection via backlink, but not rely on it alone.“ ([Ahrens, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/ZSUB2Y5K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPX6TZVK?page=8&annotation=ELVE4EFK))
