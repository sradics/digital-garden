How I get 50%+ testimonial response rates.  
  
â†’ Most course creators struggle with 10-30% response rates  
  
Everyone finishes their program and sends a generic "please leave a review" email. Then they wonder why only 1 in 10 people respond.  
  
But here is what they are missing:  
â€”â€”â€”  
Testimonials aren't about you. They're about celebrating your participants' transformation.  
  
Here's my 5-step system that generates 50%+ response rates for  
Learning Ecosystem Mastery:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Step 1: Ask during the final session  
While emotions and achievements are fresh. Not weeks later when the experience has faded.  
  
â†’ Step 2: Use a dedicated platform  
I use [testimonial.to](http://testimonial.to/) - makes it dead simple for people to record video or write text testimonials. No friction = more responses.  
  
â†’ Step 3: Follow up in your community space  
Gentle reminder where they're already engaged.  
For me, that's Circle where our learning community lives.  
  
â†’ Step 4: Personal thank you email  
Individual appreciation + testimonial request. Shows you value their specific journey.  
  
â†’ Step 5: Celebrate publicly  
Share their testimonials on LinkedIn, tagging them directly.  
This shows you honor their contribution and creates social proof for future participants  

Current results: 25% already submitted,  
another 25% promised to share once they catch up.  
  
That's 50%+ compared to the industry average of 10-30%.  
  
What is your experience with asking/providing testimonials?

Not surface-level impressions.
