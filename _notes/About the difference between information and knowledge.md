I was an information hoarder.  
  
â†’ 400+ books, thousands of notes, questionable impact.  
  
I had plenty of "high valuable" information. And I marked that as knowledge.  
I felt quite productive too.  
  
Thousands of notes. Captured and thoughtfully organized over time.  
Including highlights from over 400 books, imported to my personal knowledge base.  
  
But I was so wrong.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
Here is what I discovered:  
  
There is a crucial difference between information and knowledge.  
  
Information = raw facts and figures.  
But information lacks personal context and meaning.  
  
Knowledge = information enriched by YOUR experience.  
  
I was drowning in information while starving for knowledge.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
Why this matters:  
  
AI can retrieve any information instantly. But it can't replicate your unique context and experience.  
  
That's where your real value lies.  
  
And I recommend to Stop collecting â†’ Start connecting â†’ Begin creating  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
Here are 3 steps to start with:  
  
â†’ Step 1: Ask yourself - Is this driving current actions?  
  
Yes = keep it. No = discard or archive it.  
  
â†’ Step 2: Enrich with your thoughts.  
  
Why does this matter to ME?  
What does this connect to in MY world?  
  
â†’ Step 3: Bring it to action.  
  
Use it to create something tangible.  
  
This transforms raw information into your personal knowledge.  
  
It becomes truly yours and drives your actions.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
Want concrete examples of this in practice?  
  
Comment EXAMPLES and I'll share.
