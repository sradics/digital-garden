that they don’t have to trade speed for stability or vice versa, because by building quality in they get both. — location: [439](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=439) ^ref-20979

---
In general, they suffer from two drawbacks. First, they focus on outputs rather than outcomes. — location: [459](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=459) ^ref-57331

---
Second, they focus on individual or local measures rather than team or global ones. — location: [460](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=460) ^ref-50084

---
and focus on completing as many stories as possible at the expense of collaboration with other teams — location: [477](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=477) ^ref-36498

---
Since lead time—a measure of how fast work can be completed—is a productivity metric that doesn’t suffer from the drawbacks of the other metrics we’ve seen, it’s essential that we manage utilization to balance it against lead time in an economically optimal way. — location: [483](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=483) ^ref-25140

---
First, it should focus on a global outcome to ensure teams aren’t pitted against each other. — location: [487](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=487) ^ref-51844

---
Second, our measure should focus on outcomes not output: — location: [490](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=490) ^ref-21820

delivery lead time, deployment frequency, time to restore service, and change fail rate. — location: [492](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=492) ^ref-10102

the time it takes to design and validate a product or feature, and the time to deliver the feature to customers. — location: [496](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=496) ^ref-63958

---
Reinertsen calls this part of the lead time the “fuzzy front end” (Reinertsen 2009). — location: [498](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=498) ^ref-54088

---
However, the delivery part of the lead time—the time it takes for work to be implemented, tested, and delivered—is easier to measure and has a lower variability. — location: [498](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=498) ^ref-9523

Reducing batch size is another central element of the Lean paradigm — location: [515](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=515) ^ref-17922

Reducing batch sizes reduces cycle times and variability in flow, — location: [516](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=516) ^ref-612

---
Therefore, we settled on deployment frequency as a proxy for batch size since it is easy to measure and typically has low variability. — location: [518](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=518) ^ref-11993

failure is inevitable, so the key question becomes: How quickly can service be restored? — location: [529](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=529) ^ref-13488

“Do change management boards actually improve delivery performance?” (Spoiler alert: they do not; they are negatively correlated with tempo and stability.) — location: [639](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=639) ^ref-27457

values, which are more “visible” to group members as these collective values and norms can be discussed and even debated by those who are aware of them. — location: [674](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=674) ^ref-4818

Values also influence group interactions and activities by establishing social norms, — location: [676](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=676) ^ref-38574

These artifacts can include written mission statements or creeds, technology, formal procedures, or even heroes and rituals (Pettigrew 1979). — location: [679](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=679) ^ref-48399

Likert-type question, we assign the answer a value on a scale from 1 to 7, where 1 means “Strongly disagree” and 7 means “Strongly agree.” — location: [712](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=712) ^ref-22984

Convergent validity: making sure that items that are supposed to be related are actually related (e.g., if measures are supposed to measure organizational culture, they do measure it). Reliability: making sure the items are read and interpreted similarly by those who take the survey. This is also referred to as internal consistency. — location: [728](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=728) ^ref-57751

We hypothesized that culture would predict both software delivery performance and organizational performance. We also predicted that it would lead to higher levels of job satisfaction.2 Both of these hypotheses proved to be true. — location: [760](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=760) ^ref-6682
