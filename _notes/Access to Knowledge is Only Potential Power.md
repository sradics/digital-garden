Your knowledge is ONLY potential power

follow more than 60 newsletters,  
and own plenty of books Iâ€™ve never finished.

â†’ I'm at the forefront leveragingAI  
â†’ I maintain a vibrant ðŸ§ ðŸ§   
â†’ I APPLY KNOWLEDGE  
  
KNOWLEDGE APPLIED IS POWER  
  
It's about transforming  
captured insights into ACTION.  
  
Next time you capture an information â†’ ask:

âž  Why must I use this?

And schedule your knowledge date.  

Now, may I ask for your help?  
  
What should I do with all my hoarded
