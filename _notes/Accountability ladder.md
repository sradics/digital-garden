# Accountability ladder
[Source](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andolfimarco_worklife-motivation-futureofwork-activity-7016644788401618944-6BV9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

I can use that accountability ladder in personal coaching situation when my coachee is positioning themselves in a victim position. I can as at which levels of 8 they currently are and what is needed to either move it two steps up or even directly to level 8 - to make it happen and taking full accountability on solving a problem.
