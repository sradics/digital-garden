How I built immersion into my training

â†’ The magic happens AFTER your training session ends

Ever notice how quickly we forget what we learn in workshops?

That's why in my Learning Ecosystem Mastery program, 
I've built immersion into the core experience.

â†’ We don't just talk about knowledge management - we practice it immediately
â†’ We don't just discuss tools - we implement them during the session
â†’ We don't just learn concepts - we apply them to our own challenges

But the real magic happens after the live session ends.

I share EVERYTHING with participants - 
presentations, transcripts, summaries, and AI-generated notes - 
all directly embeddable into their own Obsidian vaults 
(the tool we're mastering together).

This creates powerful learning loops:
â†’ Participants practice using Obsidian by importing session materials
â†’ We experience presentations inside Obsidian (yes, that's possible!)
â†’ We revisit concepts while adding their own insights
â†’ We  extend learning beyond the live sessions

This approach covers the crucial "Extend" and "Perform" stages of the 4MAT learning cycle (which we'll explore in Week 2).

I've attached a short video showing how participants receive and use these materials. Notice how the presentation itself runs inside Obsidian - the same tool they're learning to master.

What's your experience with immersive learning? 
Have you found ways to extend learning beyond the initial experience?
