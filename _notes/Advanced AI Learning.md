Immersed in AI-First thinking with Michael's community  
  
â†’ I altered my entire AI conversation style in just 30 days.  
  
For the past month, I've been immersed in [Michael Simmons](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeldsimmons/)' Blockbuster Blueprint community.  
  
Michael exemplifies Learning in Public.  
He shares real work in real timeâ€”the raw stuff, not the highlights reel.  
  
  
From Michael's AI-First thinking classes I learned  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ The concept of a Trademark Idea  
â†’ The power of sequencing with AI  
â†’ Explored 7 ways to dimensionalize thinking with AI  
  
His quote made me think a lot:  
  
"The future belongs to those who can harness these new forms of information advantage effectively. The question isn't whether to adapt, but how quickly you can master these new approaches to stay ahead of the curve."  
  
His embedded Augmented Awakening run by Anand Rao  
is a Mind-Expanding Experience.  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Engaging reflection exercises push boundaries  
â†’ Showing ways to collaborate with AI in completely new ways  
  
Through that course I altered my conversation style with AI  
  
Next I'm running through his 10-weeks Augmented Intelligence course  
.. so stay tune one more insights to come.  
  
If you want to enter a next level of working with AI ...  
I can highly recommend to join Michael's community on Substack  
(Link in the comments).  
  
See you there?
