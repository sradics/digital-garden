  ðŸš€ Thrilled to Announce: Iâ€™m Now a Certified 4MAT Master! ðŸš€  
After an intensive 3-day journey through the 4MAT Mastering Training Design, I'm officially certified! A huge thanks to [Hanne Houbak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanne-houbak-4aa5252/) for leading such an insightful course and [Dr Bernice McCarthy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-bernice-mccarthy-71556415/) for developing this holistic framework.  
  
In just three days, Iâ€™ve gained invaluable insights into:  
ðŸŽ¨ Designing and planning effective  
trainings, workshops, and presentations using the 4MAT learning cycle.  
ðŸŒŸ The four 4MAT learning styles: WHY, WHAT, HOW, and WHAT IF learners.  
ðŸ§  The preferences of our cerebral hemispheres: left/right brain.  
  
I'm excited to apply these learnings in my upcoming workshop:  
"Amplify Your Second Brain and Digital Garden with AI"  
ðŸ‘‰ Next week in the NessLabs community  
  
If youâ€™re looking to enhance your course designs or  
want to dive deeper into the 4MAT framework, feel free to reach out.  
  
ðŸ‘‰ Let's connect and transform learning experiences together!

## Content preparation
I took the 4MAT Mastering Training Design and I'm now a certified 4MAT Master. Hugh thanks to Hanne Houbak for running such a well crafted course. Thanks Dr Bernice McCarthy for creating such a holistic framework.

I learned so much in 3 days about:
+ the four 4MAT learning styles namely the WHY-WHAT-HOW-WHATIF learners
+ the preferences of the cerebral hemispheres - left/right brain
+ designing and planning trainings, workshops and presentation with the 4MAT learning cycle

And I'll already apply my learnings to my upcoming workshop: 
Amplify your Second Brain and Digital Garden with AI that I'll provide next week in the NessLabs community.

In case you need a helping hand with your course designs and/or would like to get more insights about 4MAT/Learning Types or 4MAT or designing courses/workshops/presentations, please let me know.
