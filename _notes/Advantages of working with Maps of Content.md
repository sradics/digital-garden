🌳→🗺️ Organize Wild Knowledge: Maps Over Folders  
(to retrieve information super fast and get additional inspiration)  
  
Folders only cover one dimension.  
But most of my topics have many angles.  
→ I use a Map of Content to look at information from different perspectives.  
  
For example, my approach to externalizing and storing knowledge in a Second Brain continuously evolves.  
My growing knowledge about Building a Second Brain (BASB) stems from:  
▪Projects utilizing the Second Brain  
▪Presentations shared with others  
▪ Books, videos, and articles  
▪Personal reflections  
  
To quickly retain information about BASB, I created a Map of Content (MOC):  
▪Main aspects covered in an overview, linked to detailed descriptions  
▪Sources where I discuss BASB link back to the MOC  
▪this MOC has already 18 outgoing links and  
▪is mentioned in 91 further notes  
  
I use my Maps of Content as:  
💡 Entry Point: A central hub that reduces cognitive load → find info faster  
💡 Inspiration Source: Scanning backlinks just sparked 6 new content ideas  
💡 Reference Tool: Shareable with others for a quick, comprehensive overview of years of learning  
  
My triggers to introduce a Map of Content:  
↳ When a topic spans multiple notes and folders  
↳ When a central entry point for frequently used topics is needed

## Content preparation

Organize wild knowledge trees with Maps of Contents
(retrieve information super fast and get additional inspiration)

Folders help with covering one dimension only. 
If I want to look at a set of information from different perspectives I use a map of content. 

For example, I'm continuously evolving my approach to working with externalizing my knowledge and storing that in a Second Brain. My growing knowledge about Building a Second Brain stems from sources like:
+ books, videos, articles I used as learning sources
+ presentations I shared my approach with others
+ my reflections about using a Second Brain
+ projects I used it for

To fast retain information about Building a Second Brain I created a Map of Content (MOC) for the topic of Building a Second Brain (BASB):
+ I cover the main aspects in an overview and link to detailed descriptions
+ Sources where I write/talk/present about BASB link back to the MOC

Some stats for the MOC about BASB:
+ 18 outgoing links
+ The MOC is mentioned in already 91 further notes (displayed as backlinks)

I use my MOCs as:
+ an entry point for a bigger topic. Knowing about this central knowledge hub reduced my cognitive load and reduces time to retain informations
+ as source of inspiration - e.g. scanning through all the backlinks just gave me 6 news content ideas
+ as reference in my digital garden that I can share with you so that you can get a fast overview by yourself. Several years of learning, distilled and very fast to grasp.

I introduce a MOC when:
+ a topic meanders through several notes across several folders
+ I need a central entry point for a topic I often use or refer to

How do you structure your learning insights? Is working with a Map of Content something you would like to try?
