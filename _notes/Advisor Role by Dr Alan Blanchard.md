ADVISOR.

Here's what you do:

‚û°Ô∏è Document your problem as if you were describing it to someone else. Include all relevant details but avoid emotional language.
‚û°Ô∏è Break down the problem into smaller parts and analyze each part objectively.
‚û°Ô∏è Formulate advice for yourself as if you were giving it to a friend. Write down the steps you would recommend.
‚û°Ô∏è Create an action plan based on this advice and commit to following through, treating each step as an objective task rather than an emotional hurdle.
