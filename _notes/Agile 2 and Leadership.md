A Manager is a leader who has authority.

### Authority: Inside, Outside, Get-things-done
Mentioned  by Peter Drucker (Source?)
==Outward-focused leadership is about representing and advocating for a group; inward-focused leadership is about the relationship with the group, and it can be planning, organizing, directing, coordinating, or controlling (managing risk)==. â€” location: [3235](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3235) ^ref-4649

#### Inside Person
An ==Inside person== is someone who can form ==relationships of trust==, someone they ==look up to.== E.g. a visionary CTO or product designer.

it is ==someone who people admire or trust or feel is competent to make big decisions==. â€” location: [3864](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3864) ^ref-17887


#### Outside Person
An Outside person is someone to deal with the ==outside world==. Outside world means the ==larger ecosystem== a team is embedded in.
Needs some form of ==authority== to be able to ==make promises==, to ==negotiate deals== and to ==invest in resources==. 
This person needs to ==manage expectations== and come across ==personable==, ==trustworthy==, ==competent== and ==visionary==.

#### Someone to Get Things Done - The Organizer
The Organizer is someone who ==stays on top== of everything, ==watches for problems==, ==takes action==s as soon as there is a problem and ==orchestrates discussion== and timely ==decision making==.
