Needs some form of ==authority== to be able to ==make promises==, to ==negotiate deals== and to ==invest in resources==. 
This person needs to ==manage expectations== and come across ==personable==, ==trustworthy==, ==competent== and ==visionary==.

#### Someone to Get Things Done - The Organizer
The Organizer is someone who ==stays on top== of everything, ==watches for problems==, ==takes action==s as soon as there is a problem and ==orchestrates discussion== and timely ==decision making==.
