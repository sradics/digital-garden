### Self Accessment
#### Coaching
With having a formal systemic business coach education I understand and practice coaching. So I can support on level 4-5 and regularly use coaching skills when e.g. working with Engineering Managers, Leads and Agile Champions

#### Facilitation
I'm on level 5 when it comes to facilitation. I facilitated hundreds of workshops and I'm experienced on Remote and physical session facilitation. For sizes up to to 20 people.

I'm not that experienced in large group formats beyond 20 people. I facilitated some Meetups, all hands and level ups.

### Teaching
I gave several learning workshops and grew my experience in teaching. I access myself to be in level 2-3. 

Examples
+ Coaching on Agile - Cohort based training on Core Agile
+ Assumption Testing class
+ Facilitation 2 days course
+ Working with an Opportunity-Solution-Tree - course
+ Cost of Delay - 3h workshop
+ Kanban - one day workshop

### Agile Lean specialist
