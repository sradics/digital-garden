# Agile Manifesto for Business Contexts
[Business Agility: An agile approach beyond IT](https://www.nagarro.com/en/blog/agile-manifesto-achieving-business-agility)

## The Agile Values

We are uncovering better ways of developing **organizations**:

+ _Individuals and interactions over processes and tools_  
+ _Working **solutions** over comprehensive documentation_  
+ _Collaboration over **formalities**_  
+ _Responding to change over following **plans and habits**_

That is, while there is value in the items on the right,  
we value the items on the left more.

## The Agile Principles

We follow these principles:

_Our highest priority is to satisfy **our** customer_  
_through early and continuous delivery_  
_of valuable **services**._

_Welcome changing requirements, even late._  
_Agile processes harness change for_  
_the customer's advantage._

_Deliver working **solutions** frequently, from a_  
_couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a_  
_preference to the shorter timescale._

_**Experts and contact persons** must **cooperate**_  
_**closely** in their tasks._

_Build **organizations** around motivated individuals._  
_Give them the environment and support they need,_  
_and trust them to get the job done._

_The most efficient and effective method of_  
_conveying information is face-to-face conversation._

_Working **solutions** are the primary measure of progress._

_Agile processes promote sustainable development._  
_All **involved** should be able_  
_to maintain a constant pace indefinitely._

_Continuous attention to **excellence**_  
_**and quality of results** enhances agility._

_Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount_  
_of work not done--is essential._

_The best **solutions and results**_  
_emerge from self-organizing teams._

_At regular intervals, the **organization** reflects on how_  
_to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts_  
_its behavior accordingly._
