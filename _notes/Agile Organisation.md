# Agile Organisation - Week 1
+ initiating, changing and solidifying a change
+ Lewings 3 stages model
+ McKinsey 7s model

## Lewings 3 stages model
+ Unfreeze - Change - Freeze
+ Why the change is needed
	+ Why now?
	+ What are the benefits?
	+ What are consequences of not changing?
+ Find new ways of doing things and adopt the changes
	+ How does that connect with companies Values?
	+ Look at value of dispair curve
+ Bring orga back to stability
	+ Celebrate the success and mark an end of that change
+ One can compare that to bringing an ice cube into a new form

## MCKinsey 7s
+ ðŸ“– In Search of Excellence - Thomas J. Peters
+ brings a cross functional team together to use 7s for analysis and then implementing a change

### Hard Components - Strategy - Structure - Systems
+ clearly defined, can be analyses and more easily be influenced

### Soft Components - skills - styles - staff - shared values
intangible and difficult to define

### Strategy
plan of how to gain and keep market share, it's how to gain and maintain the competitive advantage.

### Structure
Structure, explains how your business is organized in terms of hierarchy, how decisions are made, and who reports to who

### Systems
Systems are processes that your organization relies upon to keep business going, software, hardware, and standard operating procedures

### Style
Style, represents a leadership style adopted throughout the organization.

### Steps for using 7s
+ identify where your particular change belongs within the 7S elements
+ analyze the alignment between this change in your organization's foundation, which has expressed their shared values. 
	+ How will this new change influence shared values? 
	+ What needs to change to support the alignment between the impact of change and shared values? 
	+ Are shared values align with the other hard elements of systems and structure? 
	+ If not, what needs to be done to align them? 
+ analyze soft elements. Do they support the hard elements after we consider the impact of the change?

3 stages:
+ ending of current state

# Week 3 - Stages of Agile Adoption
three most common definitions of an agile enterprise:
+ follows the philosophy and principles of agile and is quick in its response to changes
+ agile enterprise means having dozens of agile teams working on projects across the organization. What this definition describes is agile at scale
+ agile enterprise is one that has fully adopted agile philosophy and values throughout the organization. It's prepared to capitalize on last minute opportunities and has a unique balance of bureaucracy, an flexibility that supports the delivery of higher customer value

## Scaling Agile
+ stages: no agile - agile at scale - agile enterprise
+ ensure that your organization has a vision and that it prioritizes customer value. 
	+ BAHG - Big Audacious Hairy Goal - to inspire and energize employees, and reinvigorate a stale mission
	+ refresh on vision and values
+ prove that the Agile has merit, pilot it. 
	+ prove the value with smaller units and wins
	+ 
+ remove points of friction and transform business processes to support Agile teams


Some of the examples of where to deploy agile teams are developing a new product, creating an innovative experience for the customer, improving business processes or developing new technology.

## Case studies
### Amazon
They include a constant **obsession with customers**, a **culture of innovation**, the implementation and **use of Agile teams,** **modulus structure**, and **fast incremental delivery cycles**.

Amazon company values:
+ Amazon leadership and employees have a sense of ownership. 
+ leading by setting a standard of innovative thinking on behalf of customer needs. 
+ staying curious to learn more about the customers. 
+ delivering your results. 
+ respectfully challenging compromises, 
+ thinking big and taking care of details.
