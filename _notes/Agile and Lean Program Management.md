## Highlights
you, as a program manager, serve the program. — location: [212](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=212) ^ref-52537

organization to deliver the product. — location: [218](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=218) ^ref-50400

---
Programs are strategic collections of projects with one business objective. Program managers coordinate that one business objective — location: [219](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=219) ^ref-57940

---
across the organization. — location: [220](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=220) ^ref-12376

---
Because the agile and lean program is a complex adaptive system. Everyone has his or her own role — location: [228](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=228) ^ref-44690

---
And, everyone in the agile and lean program has to be aware of the entire rest of the program. — location: [229](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=229) ^ref-50335

---
The core team understands how their deliverables intersect with everyone else’s deliverables now, — location: [241](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=241) ^ref-30145

---
He’d never seen an architecture evolve. He’d always planned the architecture in advance. — location: [244](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=244) ^ref-32229

---
So are the feature teams. They feel as if they are part of the design thinking, not just taking orders from some guy with his head in the clouds. — location: [248](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=248) ^ref-17472

---
Many successful programs repeat these principles: build trust among the teams on the program; deliver often to see feedback; build trust across the organization. — location: [254](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=254) ^ref-18817

---
Deliver early and often to satisfy the customer. Welcome changing requirements. Deliver working software frequently. Business people and developers must work together. Trust motivated people to do their jobs. Face-to-face conversation is the most efficient and effective method of conveying information. Working software is the primary measure of progress. Maintain a sustainable pace. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential. — location: [259](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=259) ^ref-60568

---
The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. Reflect and adjust at regular intervals. — location: [264](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=264) ^ref-33023

---
Eliminate waste. — location: [270](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=270) ^ref-31792

---
Amplify learning. Decide as late as possible. Deliver as fast as possible. Empower the team. Build integrity in. See the whole. — location: [270](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=270) ^ref-48124

---
When you use agile and lean principles, you can create and steer an adaptive, resilient program. — location: [277](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=277) ^ref-51248

---
Program Is a Strategic Collection of Several Projects — location: [279](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=279) ^ref-26444

---
A program is a collection of projects, where the value is in the overall deliverable. — location: [279](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=279) ^ref-52251

---
Beware of a collection of ranked backlogs with no strategic reason behind the order. — location: [288](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=288) ^ref-30723

---
If there isn’t a larger business objective behind the backlogs, it’s not a program. — location: [288](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=288) ^ref-4006

---
Each program needs a coherent vision behind the program so you can create a program charter. — location: [293](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=293) ^ref-1250

---
With a program charter in place, the feature teams won’t need to work up and then down a hierarchy. — location: [294](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=294) ^ref-36996

---
Program management is the coordination and facilitation of all of the work across the organization to release the product. — location: [298](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=298) ^ref-21454

---
The job of the program manager is to coordinate the teams so they understand enough about each other’s risks so they can deliver. — location: [299](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=299) ^ref-60993

---
Projects are tactical; they get the work done. The program is strategic. It ties the projects together to bring them to delivery. — location: [301](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=301) ^ref-43139

---
If you employ agile approaches to programs, you get to see visible progress — location: [306](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=306) ^ref-22048

---
You don’t have to wait until the predicted or desired end of the program to see the risk. — location: [307](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=307) ^ref-9209

---
In general, incremental approaches reduce schedule risk and iterative approaches reduce technical risk. — location: [310](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=310) ^ref-60909

---
A lean approach will enable you to see bottlenecks, reduce waste, and see what is not getting done. You need both agile and lean for a program. — location: [313](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=313) ^ref-13904

---
Notice that there is no program-specific view of the product or transparent coordination across the functional teams. — location: [318](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=318) ^ref-30032

---
In program management, there is no hierarchy. Everyone collaborates and coordinates across the cross-functional teams. This collaboration avoids Coordination Chaos as in TIK14. — location: [320](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=320) ^ref-33263

---
The program teams solve problems cross-functionally. — location: [321](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=321) ^ref-4401

---
That’s a huge difference. — location: [322](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=322) ^ref-63692

are valuable to the business and learning from that work. Lean is about seeing the whole, the flow of your work, building integrity into your work, and eliminating waste. — location: [334](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=334) ^ref-31376

Take a product perspective. The principle is: “Business people and developers must work together.” — location: [357](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=357) ^ref-62778

---
use Cynefin to think about how I solve problems: Can we use good practices that everyone else uses? Do we need to experiment to know how to proceed? Do we have so many unknowns that we don’t know where to start? — location: [364](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=364) ^ref-28896

is at least in the Complicated context, because of the number of communication paths. — location: [369](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=369) ^ref-50279

---
In the Complicated context, you can see straight cause-and-effect relationships among the different stresses in your program. — location: [370](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=370) ^ref-17937

---
You understand what your unknowns are. — location: [372](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=372) ^ref-4783

---
people on your program are multitasking, or if you have people or teams who can’t commit to the program, or if many of your feature teams are new to agile, you are at least in the Complex context. — location: [376](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=376) ^ref-7658

---
You have many unknown unknowns. — location: [380](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=380) ^ref-36867

You will have to manage the risk of those unknowns. — location: [380](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=380) ^ref-23258

I’m not talking about experts that create bottlenecks by working alone. — location: [383](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=383) ^ref-22122

What experiments will you use to probe, to discover your unknowns? — location: [385](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=385) ^ref-19997

---
There are no easy answers. There is no recipe. This is work. It’s the reason why we need program management, to recognize and solve problems across the organization. — location: [393](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=393) ^ref-58951

---
Regardless of your context, a program is emergent. With emergent projects, you can’t plan everything at the beginning. — location: [397](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=397) ^ref-22676

---
You can see a roadmap, plan a little, and continue learning and adapting as you proceed. — location: [398](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=398) ^ref-53670

These programs tend to need programs of programs. Different products will run on their own schedule. Unless your vendors are also agile and lean, you may have to manage integration risks. — location: [423](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=423) ^ref-36976

One of the problems I see in too many agile programs is that they have neither a core team nor a software program team. They have many feature or component teams. They might have Scrum-of-Scrum meetings, but no real forum for solving the deep problems or managing the risks that can occur across the organization. — location: [432](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=432) ^ref-59118

Iterate on the agile roadmap. Iterate on the program backlog, the backlog of features. Solve cross-functional business problems. Solve problems that escalate from the software program team. Monitor product status and risks. Clear program obstacles for the teams.

roadmap is a wish-list, what you want to occur. Backlogs are what the teams do. As the teams finish their backlogs, the product owners update the roadmap. — location: [744](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=744) ^ref-54498

The roadmap is a wish-list. It is not a promise to fulfill. The roadmap is a product direction. — location: [747](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=747) ^ref-33585

Just like a regular map, the teams may encounter detours along the way. That’s why the product owners create ranked backlogs for the teams that are much smaller in scope. — location: [748](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=748) ^ref-52769

it’s a fine line between providing the teams a long-term perspective (the roadmap) and creating waste because what the teams implement from the backlogs will change the long-term perspective and the next backlog. — location: [763](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=763) ^ref-25045

A theme or an epic is a high-level statement of what you want for a feature. It is a promise to create stories. A theme might be: Do electronic signature. Do security for login. Password reset. — location: [775](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01C6B07EO&location=775) ^ref-24720

their backlogs, they can update the roadmap as a product value team. Continuous planning avoids the need for a large “let’s get everyone in the same room” to plan a quarter’s worth of work. Very few teams can plan for a quarter at a time and meet that plan. Your program might have interruptions from operations/support, the rank of some features might change, and teams encounter problems every day. If you plan for a quarter, you are not likely to accomplish everything you plan. With continuous planning, you update the backlogs just in time and keep your program open to change. The smaller your planning, the more likely the teams are to be able to achieve the vision and release criteria. Keep planning small. With small stories, small planning, and small teams, your program is more likely to have faster throughput and faster feedback.
