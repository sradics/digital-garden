I Take the Complicated Path

â†’ Until I Cut with Occam's Razor

Given multiple explanations or solutions, 
the simplest one is often the best or most likely to be correct.
(Occamâ€™s Razor)

This should become my mantra, 
especially after a funny situation I experienced yesterday.

I had to install a spotlight in the ceiling.
The first spot took me 3 hours. 

It wasn't because of the electrical work.
It wasn't due to missing equipment (quite the opposite ðŸ˜…).

It was because of a small fixation issue with the spotlight itself. 

I nearly destroyed the spotlight. 
I began inventing elaborate methods to fix it.
I was even thinking to adjust some of the material.

And deep inside, you hear this voice: 
"I don't think it's meant to be that complicated."

Do you remember assembling your last piece of IKEA furniture? When it gets complicated, 
it's very likely you're doing something wrong.

It was the same for me. 
After taking a power nap, 
I read the manual again (and again).

The solution was just so simple.
It then took me only 5 minutes per spotlight.

So in conclusion:
âž  Search for the simple solution

When was a time you wanted to scream at first 
but later found a simple solution?
