# An aspect of better writing on LinkedIn
[[@yitian_cheng_smarter_2025]]

## The Core Insight: Escape the Curse of Knowledge

**The Problem:** The more expert you become, the harder it gets to connect with your audience because you forget what it feels like to be a beginner.

**The Solution:** Stop using abstract expert language and start speaking directly to your audience's lived experience.

### The Framework for Better LinkedIn Writing:

**Instead of abstract concepts like:**

- "Alignment"
- "Purpose"
- "Awareness"

**Write about concrete experiences:**

1. **Emotions they feel daily:**
    
    - Anger, anxiety, exhaustion
    - Frustration, self-doubt, overwhelm
2. **Specific situations they face:**
    
    - Tense work meetings
    - Family dynamics at home
    - Quiet moments of reflection
3. **Observable behaviors:**
    
    - Blaming others
    - Second-guessing decisions
    - Numbing out with distractions

### The Writing Technique:

**Use "You" to create relatable stories** that paint a vivid picture of their daily reality, rather than abstract professional jargon.

**Example transformation:**

- ‚ùå "Your lack of alignment is evident in your daily job"
- ‚úÖ "You're sitting in yet another endless meeting. Your heart rate picks up every time you're asked a question..."

### The Result:

When you speak clearly about what your audience feels every day, your content transforms from vague and abstract to magnetic and relatable‚Äîattracting your dream clients.

**Bottom line:** Meet your audience where they are emotionally, not where you are intellectually.
