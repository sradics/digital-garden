# [[Apps becomes a new form of Express ]]

## LinkedIn Post

[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_i-used-to-think-i-wish-i-had-a-tool-for-activity-7365625004249477121-_zzb?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAA1M1pkBgWCYPhT45EpfLiHzViQqRWNCIv4)

I used to think "I wish I had a tool for that."

â†’ Now I think "I'll build that tool today."

The Old Me: 
â€”â€”â€”
Saw problems everywhere but felt not ready to solve them.

Personas scattered across documents? "Someone should build a tool for that."

LinkedIn networking taking forever? "There must be an app for this."

I was a consumer of solutions (if exists and affordable), not a creator.

My new reality:
â€”â€”â€”
Vibe Coding turns me into a builder.

Two examples from just this week:

â†’ The Persona Helper (built in 2 hours) 
6 personas Ã— 30 dimensions = chaos 

Now: Clean JSON, AI insights, organized overview

â†’ LinkedIn Assistant (built in 3 hours)  
Profile analysis used to take minutes per person 
Now: Instant insights for better networking

In this new era my thinking shifts from: "I need a solution" (and wait months for someone else to build it) to "I build a solution" (often within the same day)

It's about becoming someone who builds solutions instead of waiting for them.

Frustrations become a building opportunity. The "I wish..." becomes "I'll create..."

What activities in your work are screaming for a custom solution?

Have you considered building it yourself?
