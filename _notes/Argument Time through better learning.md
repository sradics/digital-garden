Time is our scarcest resource.  
  
→ “The trouble is, you think you have time.”  
-- Buddha --  
  
When it comes to learning, we:  
  
→ Scan a book in detail again.  
→ Re-Do work because it got lost.  
→ Waste time searching for information.  
  
Because it’s time-consuming, we often don’t:  
  
→ Share insights with our peers  
→ Boost creativity with connections  
→ Feed AI personalized data for better results

Imagine through learning faster you could:  
  
→ Solve an important aspect in your job faster.  
→ Master a special qualification earlier.  
→ Land your next job in a new field.  
→ Win back time for freedom.

My win back time strategy for learning:  
  
Our mind is for having ideas, not holding them.  
-- David Allen --  
  
I use a 🧠 Second Brain 🧠 to  
↳ Capture  
↳ Organize  
↳ Distill  
↳ Express  
  
➠ and win back time with each thought
