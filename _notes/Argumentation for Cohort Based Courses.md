# Argumentation for Cohort Based Courses

> [!note] Definition for CBC
>  Cohort-based courses (CBCs), **==interactive online courses==** where a group of students **advances through the material together** in “cohorts” — with **hands-on, feedback-based learning** at the core.

## The problem with traditional online courses MOOCs

MOOC stands for *massively open online courses*. 

+ **==low completion rate==** just 3 to 6 percent [^2]
	+ **no build in urgency**, when you can watch/learn anytime
+ only for one-directional learning with no (immediate) opportunity for questions in real-time. So MOOCs primarily for knowledge transfer.

## Main reasons for learning with CBCs

+ **==What is scarce in online learning is community.==**
+ much **==higher completion== rate** than MOOCs (example altMBA 96% completion rate)
+ for teaching anything that requires feedback, discussion, hands-on practice
+ for developing **==higher-order skills==** that **require analysis, evaluation, synthesis, judgement and creativity**. (*not sure how CBCs support on all these skills. Likely a cohorts adds the group element to the skills and complements the solo variant of e.g. analysis*)

### Argumentation for better learning via CBC

+ **==Interleaving learning==** - instructors mix different topics, ideas and activities with intentionally switching between them
	+ e.g. via breakouts, role-play, discussions, debates with instructor or fellow-learners
+ **engaging and real-time** instead of passive and solo
* **learning manifests with more efforts taken** while making mistakes, stumbling, pitching, iterating, drawing inspiration and learning from each other
+ ==**interactive processing**== as most powerful **approach to comprehension and retention** [^1]
	+ **discussions** and **debates** produce **new ideas and points of view**
+ **==bi-directional learning==** - exchange of knowledge between **instructor and learner** with and **learner with fellow learners**
+ **social interaction** helps learners to achieve their goals
	+ longer term support of each other also after the course itself
+ (likely needed) **accountability and urgency** that comes from **time constraints of a live course**

## Some building blocks of CBCs

+ live lectures with instructors
+ active participation in conversations
+ applied learning exercises
+ **fixed** start and end **date** to enforce real-time aspect and create scarcity (assumption: scarcity as driver for engagement)
+ build in social contract 
	+ assumption: via gaining reputation when showing up and/or not leaving the group hanging
	+ assumption: being in a learning community real-time is a scarce moment too
