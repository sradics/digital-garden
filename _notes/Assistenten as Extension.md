I felt like a fraud charging premium rates.  
  
â†’ Then I discovered how to scale my expertise while I sleep.  
  
Here's the coaching dilemma:  
  
Your clients need support 24/7.  
You can't be available 24/7.  
  
And charging what deep expertise is actually worth? Most clients can't afford it.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
The math doesn't work.  
  
AI assistants change this for coaches like us.  
  
Now my expertise works around the clock:  
  
â†’ Delivering factual knowledge faster than any book  
â†’ Providing personalized reflections and exercises  
â†’ Being available when clients need breakthrough moments  
  
No scheduling. No time zones. No guilt about pricing.  
  
My clients get immediate support for:  
â†’ Processing workshop insights at 2 AM  
â†’ Working through exercises at their own pace  
â†’ Accessing my frameworks without waiting for our next session  
  
The assistant handles the knowledge delivery.  
I focus on the high-value strategic work only I can do.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
Everyone wins.  
  
If you're a coach, author, or expert...  
  
What's stopping you from turning your expertise into an AI assistant?
