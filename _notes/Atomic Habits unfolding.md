💪 How I reached 10x growth in fitness in 3 months
(and how you reach that with 5 simple steps too) 

I hate these push-ups a little every day. But once done I actually love it. 

In just 3x months I reached >10x growth with my daily push ups routine. From 11 to 135! (and 200 within 4 minutes). 

I follow 5 simple steps. Build your routine this way: 
✪ I take a small! step daily!
✪ I make starting super easy. Define your time-routine, all prepared, no excuses
✪ I accept plateaus and recommend you push through
✪ I enjoy the moment, once you did it. And I project that moment before I exercising.
✪ I connect it with my longevity north star and a goal for the quarter - was 50 ... reached 135 for Q1!

Follow me for becoming your accountability partner and let's share learnings and motivate each other
