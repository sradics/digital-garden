Unleash Your Potential: Automate Your Life for What Truly Matters! 🚀  
(6 insights from my personal knowledge management)  
  
Imagine a life where mundane tasks are automated, leaving you free to focus on what truly matters. Sounds appealing, right? Well, it's not just a fantasy; it's achievable with a well-structured productivity system. 🌐  
(for a short overview about my system read: Unleashing the Power of Personal [hashtag#KnowledgeManagement](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=knowledgemanagement&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7157288696088596480): Uncover My Unique Tool Stack 🛠️ [https://lnkd.in/eFYWEk8n](https://lnkd.in/eFYWEk8n))  
  
By integrating task managers, digital calendars, note-taking apps, and email apps, you can streamline your workflow and save precious time.  

✪ My insights from Kindle or Matter are automatically synced with my Second Brain in Obsidian. No more manual copy & paste necessary.  
✪ I export the highlights I've made on [Blinkist](https://www.linkedin.com/company/blinkist/) through their web platform, which is a fantastic feature that allows me to export all the highlights from a Book-in-Blinks fast. (looking forward to further automation support with this one in future)  
✪ Using [Todoist](https://www.linkedin.com/company/todoistsd/) as my task manager, I integrated it everywhere - creating tasks with attached content directly in Slack, via voice input, or directly from an email.  
✪ Scheduling woes? [Calendly](https://www.linkedin.com/company/calendly/) has been a lifesaver by allowing seamless session bookings. Free time won from avoiding the wasteful scheduling.  
✪ My digital garden thrives with automation, extracting tagged notes from my Second Brain to share knowledge with everyone.  
✪ AI? A game-changer. It's my summarizer and companion in expressing thoughts, and a significant part of my automation journey.  
  
Consider the Digital Productivity Pyramid by Tiago Forte:  
✪ Digital Literacy - The basics of how to use computers effectively  
✪ Time Management - How to deploy your most fundamental limited resource, which is time  
✪ Task Management - How to organize information to maximize the use of an even more limited resource, which is your attention  
✪ Knowledge Management - How to use ideas and knowledge, both your own and others, to create reusable assets that deliver value even when you're not there  
✪ Project Management - Still developing: Pivotal elements will include project management, working "just-in-time," creative endeavors, and AI  
  
The tools available for the first three levels are already highly advanced, allowing for significant automation and simplification. By upgrading and utilizing the right tools, you can reduce unnecessary and tedious manual tasks. This frees up time to focus on more complex activities that benefit both you and others.

Automate Your Life: Freeing Time for What Matters Most
(Automations in my PKM)

A well-structured productivity system, including task managers, digital calendars, note-taking apps, and email apps, can streamline your workflow and save time. In my recent post: Unleashing the Power of Personal [KnowledgeManagement](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=knowledgemanagement&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7156926314552156161): Uncover My Unique Tool Stack 🛠️ you can find an insight about my Personal Knowledge management approach.

Some automations in that approach:
+ My captured and already distilled insights from reading a book in Kindle and from scanning through an article, video transcript or podcast transcript in Matter are automatically synced with my Second Brain in Obsidian. No more manually copy & pasting.
+ Highlights that I took at Blinkist I can export via the Blinkist Web and it's great feature to export all highlight from a Book-in-Blinks.
+ My task manager TodoIst is deeply integrated in my workflows. I can create tasks with attached content with minimum effort. E.g. via context menu in Slack, via a Voice input on my phone, directly from an eMail
+ Calendly helps a lot to helps others book a session with me and for me to get rid of wasteful time scheduling activities
+ I feed my digital garden via an automation to extract tagged notes from my Second Brain and make it accessible for everyone. I reached already a 90% automated chain for that.
+ The by far biggest automation I experience in the many aspects I'm leveraging AI as summarizer and companion when expressing my thoughts. (I'll write about that soon too, so please follow me if that might be interesting too)

In the context of looking at automations I can also highly recommend to look at the Digital Productivity Pyramid by Tiago Forte and it's five layers:
+ **Digital Literacy:** The basics of how to use computers effectively
+ **Time Management:** How to deploy your most fundamental limited resource, which is time
+ **Task Management:** How to organize information to maximize the use of an even more limited resource, which is your attention
+ **Knowledge Management:** How to use ideas and knowledge, both your own and others, to create reusable assets that deliver value even when you're not there
+ **Still developing:** Pivotal elements will include project management, working "just-in-time," creative endeavors, and AI

Especially on the first 3 levels, the tools available are already on a high maturity level and one can automate and simplify a lot, just by leveling up and using appropriate available tool. And at the same time, unlearn wasteful and meaningless manual work and dedicate the free time for higher order activities that help yourself and others to become better.
