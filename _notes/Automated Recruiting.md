# Automated Recruiting

One of the tactics Teresa recommends is **recruiting participants while they’re using your product or service**

they started automating user recruitment, began interviewing one to five users weekly, and **transitioned to a storytelling model for interviews**.

He’s found that using better **framing questions like “What time was it?” and “Who else was there?”** has helped them **get stories that relate to their research goals**

I proposed we create a similar **Pendo pop-up in-app that’s linked to a Microsoft Bookings page** that lets users schedule their own interviews based on the team’s availability.

We’ve pretty quickly been able to identify opportunities and test our assumptions, with a few being invalidated in a very short window of time.”

**Sharing interviews has had a ripple effect**. Not only is Dan’s team helping others understand what they’re learning from customers, but they’re also getting other stakeholders bought into the process of continuous interviewing

## Some general hints for interview scheduling
+ Book twice as many interviews as you need.
+ Dan says about 50% of interviews are no shows
+ If you can, include a dial-in phone number into your meeting link as an alternate method.
