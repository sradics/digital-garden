# BASB  - My ways to capture to my Second Brain
## Capture direct thoughts
When I'm on my desktop I capture my thoughts direct as either a [[What is a fleeting note| fleeting note]] or a [[What are permanent notes| permanent note]] in my Obsidian Second Brain. When I need to be super fast I just add a thought to my daily journal note in Obsidian in section *Discovered today*.

When I'm on my Remarkable paper note device, I create a note in a [[PARA Method Notes| PARA]] folder. If it seems important enough I later convert that via OCR in Remarkable to text that I can then store as note in Obsidian. Sometime I also just store the plain Remarkable export as Pdf. (*could be automated further, but currently there is no real need*)

## Capture Web content via Matter
I use  [Matter read later app](https://web.getmatter.com/). This is installed on my Desktops and my Phone. In addition to forwarding Web-Content I also use Matter to subscribe to newsletters. Therefore I use the eMail address provided by Matter. This keeps my eMail inbox clean.

## Capture eMail content via Matter forward
I forward eMails from that I'd like to keep certain part in my Second Brain through Matter. I just label an eMail in Google Mail with the label *matter_forward* and use a Google Script that scans for such labels and forward to my Matter eMail address (see also [[#Capture Web content via Matter]]).

## Capture book highlights via Kindle Obsidian plugin
I connected my Second Brain in Obsidian with my Kindle account via [obsidian-kindle-plugin](https://github.com/hadynz/obsidian-kindle-plugin). All highlights in Kindle book are automatically fetched to my literature notes folder in my Second Brain

## Capture via Audio Recording
+ I record Audio in my iPhone using the App [**JustPressRecord**](https://www.openplanetsoftware.com/just-press-record/)
+ I share the transcript in my GoogleDrive Folder *AudioTranscript*
+ A Google-Script scans that folder for all entries not named *processed_* and forwards entries to my [Matter read later app](https://web.getmatter.com/)
+ When I find time I highlight in Matter and save the item to my Matter queue, that then gets automatically imported to Obsidian
