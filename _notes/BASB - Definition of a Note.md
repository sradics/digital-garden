## Leading questions to discover candidates for new notes
**What creative raw material do I already have access too?**

My answers on 2023-05-06_Sat:
+ My already established **Second Brain**
+ My [previous Blog](https://ontheagilepath.net/) ... that I can extract further building blocks from
+ My **captured learnings from previously taken courses** 
	+ about writing
	+ python and R
	+ PowerMBA
	+ Project Management
+ My **systemic coaching education** and **SAM material**

**If I had access to each *knowledge building block* I've ever collected ... what would I do with it?**

My answers on 2023-05-06_Sat:
+ use it in my work context to solve concrete product (development) problems faster
+ build blocks of my life faster ... and drive being more independent 
+ support the learning process for others more easily
