# Basb - Keynotes from Summit - 8 ways to self sabotage

basb = building a second brain

## Why he thought about basb
+ organize thoughts and brain
+ need to be more organized and productive
+ frustration with the mess of my knowledge
+ get better in expressing my perspective
+ trying to get organized for years

## 8 ways for Self Sabotage
### Starting from scratch
+ again and again and again
+ dopamin kick

### Feeling guilty
+ ==nr 1 blocker for not changing behavior is shame==
+ vs. feeling curios (mutually exclusive to feeling guilty)
+ go easy on yourself

### Insisting on perfection
+ safety, control
+ ==don't have to try as it is not yet safety==
+ avoid critics
+ vs. embrace play; try failing in public

### Doing ALL the research first
+ if you use it as excuse for postponing
+ vs. 2nd brain to organize you to take action
+ vs. creating an MVP
+ ==limit research by defining what you need to know to take the next step==
+ ==timebox research and the take action==

### Going big
+ ... what is the moonshot
+ ... what is the most ambitious goal
+ ==vs. thinking small and taking small actionable steps==; intermediate packets

### Doing it completely by yourself
+ ==chasing for RESPECT==
+ or showing you that it is a bad idea
+ avoiding rejections
+ vs. getting more perspectives (at least a 10x becomes possible) and using the strengths of others and learning faster

### Comparing yourself to others
+ an excuse to not try or even start
+ ==vs. compare yourself to past you==

### Postponing gratification
+ to be sustainable it needs to have pleasure
+ vs. ==How can I enjoy this 10% more? -- Find a way to it...==
+ vs. Giving yourself a reward; appreciation and gratitude

## Self commitment
Create a commitment for yourself for the next event/session/... about something you change.
