## 4 Keystones for beating procrastination

+ **Use pacts** with yourself for preventing distractions

## 1 - Master triggers
### Be Aware to Triggers
Distraction **starts from within**. So it is important to raise awareness to [[Trigger |Triggers]].
+ What is **something uncomfortable to escape from**?
+ What is an **internal source to be aware of**?

**Negative feelings** make us vulnerable to distraction.

When we notice that we get distracted:
+ Start an inner dialog with yourself
+ **What are we being distracted from?**
+ Notice triggers:
	+ What is it?
	+ When did it occur?
	+ How did you feel?
	+ What did you think? What thoughts tiggered?

### Respond

	+ e.g. convert to a challenge

## 2 - Safe guard time

	+ Plan quality time for yourself including Sleep
	+ How do you want to spend time to take care of yourself?

	+ meetings
