## 4 Keystones for beating procrastination
+ **Master triggers** - awareness and work on it
+ **Safeguard time** - self, relationship, work

+ **Use pacts** with yourself for preventing distractions

## 1 - Master triggers
### Be Aware to Triggers
Distraction **starts from within**. So it is important to raise awareness to [[Trigger |Triggers]].
+ What is **something uncomfortable to escape from**?
+ What is an **internal source to be aware of**?

**Negative feelings** make us vulnerable to distraction.

When we notice that we get distracted:
+ Start an inner dialog with yourself
+ **What are we being distracted from?**
+ Notice triggers:
	+ What is it?
	+ When did it occur?
	+ How did you feel?
	+ What did you think? What thoughts tiggered?

### Respond
+ Make tasks more fun. 
	+ e.g. convert to a challenge

## 2 - Safe guard time

	+ Plan quality time for yourself including Sleep
	+ How do you want to spend time to take care of yourself?
+ your relationship

	+ e.g. plan focus time and cut back office distractions

## 3 - Safeguard focus

	+ e.g. with folder system folder today, folder week
	+ meetings
		+ insist on agenda and an overview on what has been done already
	+ work with read later apps
