## Highlights
* The ones that will deliver the most bang for your buck? The $10K equivalent of Becoming indispensable?
* The ==linchpin is an individual who can walk into chaos and create order, someone who can invent, connect, create, and make things happen==.
* ==Develop unique skills * Become their Tylenol * Become an information conduit.==

### Develop unique (yet adjacent) skills
* Learning new skills is a ==surefire path to becoming indispensable.==
* we should look closer to home: adding adjacent skills.
* Adjacent skills are ==quicker to learn and deliver more bang for the buck==
* Adjacent skill ==play on what you know already== and help you make better use of them.
### Turn yourself into Tylenol
* Tylenol products ==solve a specific problem a customer is looking for a solution for==. Vitamin products try to make a customerâ€™s life better in some way when they didnâ€™t even know they had a problem to solve.
* ==Be your bossâ€™ second brain==. Track their tasks, deliverables, and deadlines.
* ==Organize your teamâ€™s information.== ==Knowledge workers spend 4.5 hours a week looking for files==. If thatâ€™s not Tylenol, I donâ€™t know what is.
* ==Create dashboards==. Your boss is struggling for a centralized place containing the teamâ€™s metrics, goals and KPIs. Create this doc in a simple spreadsheet (or more advanced no-code app), and constantly ==remind them where they can find it==.
* ==summarize the key takeaways== in a format thatâ€™s friendly for your boss to consume.
### Become a conduit (to unique information)
* ==not underestimate the influence of shadow power==â€”advisors, assistants, consultants, and most especially spouses.
* ==generosity-first networking== (which BTW is one of the most popular modules from Supercharge your Productivity).
* Having a system * ==Following-up methodically== * Leading with generosity * ==Connecting the dots==
