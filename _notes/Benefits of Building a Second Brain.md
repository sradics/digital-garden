My notes reflect who I am today.

â†’ They're more than just information.

I'm using the Second Brain approach by Tiago Forte for 3 years now.

A Second Brain is for
(C)apturing, (O)rganizing, (D)istilling, and (E)xpressing information 
to create a reliable, accessible system 
that enhances productivity, creativity, and learning.

On my daily walk I recently asked myself: 
What is my WHY for using a Second Brain?
Am I sure that I don't just use it for the sake of it?

This ONE benefit stood out:

â†’ I have easy access to my learnings, insights and current projects. 

âž  I avoid the frustration of searching and "wasting" time

But what is my need behind that benefit?

âž  I can help others fast. It fuels my desire to contribute and support others.

âž  It nurtures my growth by allowing me to build on what Iâ€™ve learned.

âž  It reflects my wish to leave a footprint, making my work lasting and impactful.

Now I asked: What would I miss if someone destroys my current Second Brain?

Actually, that question moves me. 
It might be cheesy to say. 
But it would feel like losing parts of myself. 

Over the years I expressed so much of myself in my notes. 
My Second Brain became part of my identity.
A repository not just of information, but of my thoughts, experiences, and evolution.

A mirror of my journey, capturing my growth 
and leaving an imprint of my unique perspective.

Tell me, am I too attached?

P.S.  
I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease
