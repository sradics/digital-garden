## Purpose
To listen and follow your own inner voice

> [!important]
> 
We determine who we are and what we feel through our **own** thoughts.

Long term happiness results from who/what we are instead of what we possess.

## Consciousness
Ability to observe yourself, your thoughts and emotions. By watching yourself and your close surrounding.

Our Action starts with a thought followed by an emotion. (*I'm not so sure about that as other sources mention that our unconscious mind already created an answer before we think consciously.*)

> [!question]
> 
Who do you really want to be?

> [!question]
> 
How do you really want to be?

Connect with our **gut feeling**, a network of nerves around our solar plexus that is directly linked with our ancestor reptile brain. It is lightening fast and unconscious.

## Magnetism
We get back the energy that we send. So our thoughts and way of behaving matter. 

> [!important]
> We should understand (difficult) situations as chances to grow and learn.

> [!question]
> What is good about a situation? 

> [!question]
> What can I learn from it?

## Processing emotions
1. Notice
2. Accept and undergo
3. Let go

## Self esteem
Self esteem is a mirror for our inner voice. And this can be formed by a lot of previous situations and attributions from others. So it becomes important observe your thoughts and emotions and trace back where it is coming from.

> [!important]
> You decide by yourself if you'd like to be happy!

> [!question]
> What would someone do, who is really loving himself/herself?
