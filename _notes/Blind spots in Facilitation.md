# [[Blind spots in Facilitation]]
## LinkedIn Post
[Post at LinkedIn]()

While you're proud of your slides  
  
â†’ they're wondering if faking a call is too obvious  
  
Meet Sarah,  
tasked with training her team on a new microservices architecture.  
  
Despite using interactive exercises, colorful visuals, and gamification  
â€” all the recommended techniques â€”  
her training failed.  
  
A month later, no one applied what she taught.  
  
3 Blindspots that derailed her efforts:  
  
Blindspot 1: Learning Style Tunnel Vision  
â€”â€”â€”  
Sarah designed for her analytical mind,  
unconsciously alienating 75% of participants who learn differently.  
  
  
Blindspot 2: The Broken Learning Cycle  
â€”â€”â€”  
Sarah jumped to WHAT (technical details) before establishing WHY (purpose).  
  
â†’ Theory trumped practical implementation  
â†’ Context adaptation was never addressed  
  
She interrupted the brain's natural information processing sequence.  
  
  
Blindspot 3: The Content Overload Trap  
â€”â€”â€”  
Sarah believed more content meant better training.  
  
Reality: The overwhelmed brain retains almost nothing.  
  
Each additional concept actually reduced learning effectiveness.  
  
â†’ They sabotage even well-prepared sessions  
â†’ These blindspots hide behind "best practices"  
â†’ They explain why knowledge transfer often fails
