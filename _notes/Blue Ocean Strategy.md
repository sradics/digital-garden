## Blue Ocean mindset
When managers are urged to secure a competitive advantage, what are they likely to do? They automatically look to the competition, assess what their competitors do, and strive to do it better. But, in so doing, their strategic thinking unknowingly regresses toward the competition. The competition becomes the defining variable of strategy, not buyer value. [^1]
