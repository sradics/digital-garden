How I gain instant access to all my Kindle wisdom

â†’ Meet Booky - the Kindle Library Navigator

This assistant is based on all my highlights from about 350 books on my Kindle.

Now I can:
â†’ Search for books about [topic]
â†’ Find highlights from [author]
â†’ Show me quotes about [concept]

And even more advanced, I ask:
â†’ What books discuss similar themes to [book title]
â†’ Find connections between [concept A] and [concept B]
â†’ Group highlights about [broad topic]

â†’ Show me contradictory views on [topic]
â†’ Find quotes that support [argument/position]

I followed these steps:
1) Extract all Highlights from Kindle
2) Import to a Knowledge Folder in Langdock
3) Create an AI assistant with detailed instructions

The short video is Bookyâ€™s introduction.
The image is its description of how it sees itself.

What do you think ... would such an AI assistant support your book insight retrieval?
