I want to access my best ideas in seconds, not hours

â†’ How I use building blocks to compound

2 days ago I ran the Learning That Pays Dividends workshop.  
It was a journey through building a system to compound knowledge.  
  
One core aspect, thinking about your learning building blocks.  
Like Lego Blocks, they form the basic elements for putting learnings together in new ways to:  
â†’ Create presentations  
â†’ Run workshops  
â†’ Write a long form article (or even a book)  
  
When I thought about the building blocks I use, 
I came up with these 4 different types:  
â€”â€”â€”
â†’ Notes (e.g. book highlights, thoughts)  
â†’ Entry points to a cluster of notes - my Maps of Content  
â†’ Items I express with like Presentations, Workshop designs, Newsletters, Videos  
â†’ AI assistants that I currently build in Langdock, as GPTs and in Notebook LM  
  
All contain previous learnings that I did externalize in my Second Brain.  
All are part of my Second Brain(my system where all my externalized knowledge resides)
  
I learned that easy access and a fast way to retain insights matters when I work on a project, where I want to leverage my previous learnings.  
  
Being clear about What/Where/How of your core building blocks helps a lot.  
  
It's the difference between hunting for scattered Lego pieces versus having them organized where you can grab exactly what you need, when you need it.  
  
With these 3 questions you can reflect on your building blocks usage:  
â€”â€”â€”

What are 5 specific pieces of valuable knowledge  
you've collected that could serve as building blocks?  
  
Where do these building blocks currently live?  
Are they easy to retain or scattered across different apps, devices, or platforms with a high effort to re-use?  
  
What would be your first step to easier retention and faster building block usage?  
  
P.S.  
If you want to get the recording of the Workshop, comment or DM me "compound"
