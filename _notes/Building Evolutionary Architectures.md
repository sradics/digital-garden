## Highlights
introducing changes to a highly dynamic (eco)system can yield unpredictable results. — location: [146](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075RR1XVG&location=146) ^ref-55460

---
Enterprise architects can no longer rely on static 5-year plans because the entire software development universe will evolve in that timeframe, rendering every long-term decision potentially moot. — location: [156](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075RR1XVG&location=156) ^ref-13601

---
Although we cannot predict when changes in the technical or domain landscape will occur, or which changes will persist, we know change is inevitable. Consequently, we should architect our systems knowing the technical landscape will change. — location: [176](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075RR1XVG&location=176) ^ref-8032

---
by making change less expensive by automating formerly manual processes and other advances such as DevOps. — location: [180](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075RR1XVG&location=180) ^ref-24071

---
That’s why software architecture is defined as the “parts hard to change later.” — location: [182](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075RR1XVG&location=182) ^ref-33180

---
what if we build changeability into the architecture? — location: [185](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075RR1XVG&location=185) ^ref-44531

---
continual architecture: building architectures that have no end state and are designed to evolve with the ever-changing software — location: [205](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075RR1XVG&location=205) ^ref-51792

---
An evolutionary architecture supports guided, incremental change across multiple dimensions. — location: [209](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075RR1XVG&location=209) ^ref-33994

---
During development, an architecture that allows small, incremental changes is easier to evolve because developers have a smaller scope of change. — location: [214](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075RR1XVG&location=214) ^ref-64549

---
A fitness function is an objective function used to summarize how close a prospective design solution is to achieving the set aims. — location: [233](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075RR1XVG&location=233) ^ref-531

---
If architects want to create an architecture that can evolve, they must consider all parts of the system that change affects. — location: [257](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075RR1XVG&location=257) ^ref-20291

---
To build an evolvable system, architects must think about how the system might evolve across all the important dimensions. — location: [288](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075RR1XVG&location=288) ^ref-40981
