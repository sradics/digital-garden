## Highlights
* ==Gardens - address this underlying Problem: No place to store and evolve deeper longer-term thinking==
* To keep the ball bouncing with your flow—to maintain that open channel of communication—while you work on some kick-ass stock in the background.
* So I am looking for a ==space to nurture, edit in real time and evolve my thinking==.
* ==A space for collecting the dots==
* a space for collecting (and organizing) the dots is a ==crucial foundation for thinking, creativity== and more:
	* [Ink and Switch: capstone, a tablet for thinking](https://www.inkandswitch.com/capstone/)
* apparently, ==folders and files is the “best in class” tool== (better than tags and search) for personal information management
	* [Bergman and Whittaker report](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/science-managing-our-digital-stuff)
	* [[The Science of Managing Our Digital Stuff - Ofer Bergman Steve Whittaker]]
* [Tom Chritchlow's wiki approach](https://github.com/tomcritchlow/tomcritchlow.github.io)

* Interesting list of [Wikis and links about PKMS](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/wikis/)
