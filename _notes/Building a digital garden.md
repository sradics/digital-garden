## Highlights
* ==Gardens - address this underlying Problem: No place to store and evolve deeper longer-term thinking==
* To keep the ball bouncing with your flow‚Äîto maintain that open channel of communication‚Äîwhile you work on some kick-ass stock in the background.
* So I am looking for a ==space to nurture, edit in real time and evolve my thinking==.
* ==A space for collecting the dots==
* a space for collecting (and organizing) the dots is a ==crucial foundation for thinking, creativity== and more:
	* [Ink and Switch: capstone, a tablet for thinking](https://www.inkandswitch.com/capstone/)
* apparently, ==folders and files is the ‚Äúbest in class‚Äù tool== (better than tags and search) for personal information management
	* [Bergman and Whittaker report](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/science-managing-our-digital-stuff)
	* [[The Science of Managing Our Digital Stuff - Ofer Bergman Steve Whittaker]]
* [Tom Chritchlow's wiki approach](https://github.com/tomcritchlow/tomcritchlow.github.io)
	* The ==root wiki page loops through all the files to create a master index== automatically. 
	* meat of the wiki is contained in note files which are just markdown files so easily portable.
	* of the complexity and ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù lies in the layout and index files and none of the complexity lies in the files and folders which remain text files for longevity and easy portability.
* And there‚Äôs lots more too - [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow/status/1083823277712248832) has a whole bunch of interesting rabbit holes.
* Interesting list of [Wikis and links about PKMS](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/wikis/)
