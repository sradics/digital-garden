$10/Year: How I Built My Thriving 'Mind Garden'  
(Share your ideas with a super affordable setup)  
  
Two years ago, I started a 'Mind Garden' â€“ a space to share my thoughts and connect with others. It's been a hit, especially my real-time AI summit summaries!  
  
Whatâ€™s even more surprising? My entire tech stack costs just $10/year (just for my domain name!).  
  
Here's the breakdown:  
â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾  
â†³ GitHub â€” stores my Second Brainâ€™s insights in form of Markdown files  
â†³ Jekyll with Custom Plugins â€” transforms Markdown into HTML  
â†³ Cloudflare Pages â€” delivers the Mind Garden to you  
â†³ Algolia â€” makes everything searchable  
â†³ Sender â€” manages my newsletter  
  
.  
My Super-Fast Workflow:  
1) Obsidian: Where I write down ideas.  
2) Python script: Sends notes to GitHub.  
3) Cloudflare Pages: Publishes instantly.  
  
This setup means publishing new thoughts in mere seconds.  
  
Want to build your own Mind Garden?  
Iâ€™m considering a deeper dive into this process. Would that be valuable to you?

How I grow my Mind Garden and express myself
(a complete tech stack for just $10/YEAR)

Two years ago I started my journey with growing my mind garden. It helped me with sharing insights fast and connecting. I helped learners to get deeper insights. E.g. my real-time summaries from an AI summit were in big demand. 

All build on a really cool stack of technology, that actually just costs me $10/YEAR! for the domain. Isn't that crazy?

Here is a very brief tech stack run-through:
+ Cloudflare Pages deliver the Mind Garden to you
+ actually the $10 are for my domain, also registered through Cloudflare
+ My Second Brain extract is available as Markdown in a GitHub repository, that is used by the Cloudflare pages
+ Markdown is converted to HTML via Jekyll and many small plugins I created
+ Search is powered by Algolia
+ Newsletter subscription implemented with Sender

And this a very brief flow from thought to public:
+ Write in my local Obsidian Second Brain
+ Export via a simple Python script and store in GitHub
+ automated publishing through Cloudflare pages

So publishing new thoughts take me some seconds. 

Are you interested in learning more about that? I think about documenting my approach in more detail, so let me know if that is of value for you.
