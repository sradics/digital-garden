# [[Building a program - with AI help]]

## LinkedIn Post

[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_they-said-ai-would-replace-thinking-activity-7293161636004016128-nHz5?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAA1M1pkBgWCYPhT45EpfLiHzViQqRWNCIv4)

They said AI would replace thinking...

â†’ Then I watched my Second Brain and AI partner dance.

Two days of deep collaboration revealed something fascinating:
â†’ AI challenging my assumptions
â†’ My Second Brain providing real experience
â†’ Together creating unexpected depth

Example? When crafting our 12-week program:
â€”â€”â€”

AI asked about learning styles. 
I pulled years of workshop experience from my notes. 

AI spotted patterns I'd missed. 
I questioned if they'd work in practice. 

Back and forth, each iteration stronger.

The magic wasn't in replacement - it was in the synergy:
â€”â€”â€”
â†’ AI's ability to see the whole picture while diving into details
â†’ My Second Brain providing battle-tested insights
â†’ Our shared ability to say "this isn't clear enough yet"
â†’ The constant swing between vision and practicality

Like having a brilliant thinking partner who's read all my notes and 
keeps asking the right questions.

Most surprising? The compound effect:
My organized knowledge + AI's processing power =
Ideas neither could generate alone.

Want to see what emerged?

The result: A powerful learning transformation built on three pillars:
â†’ Mindset Mastery: Transform how you approach learning
â†’ Knowledge System Enhancement: Build your Second Brain
â†’ AI-Amplified Intelligence: Create compound growth

All combined in a 12-week journey to exponential learning.
