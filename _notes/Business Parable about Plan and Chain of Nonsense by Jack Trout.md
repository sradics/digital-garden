# Business Parable about Plan and Chain of Nonsense by Jack Trout
The Plan
----------------------------------------------------
In the beginning was the Plan.
And then came the Assumptions.
And the Assumptions were without form.
And the Plan was completely without substance.
 
 
The Workers
----------------------------------------------------     
And the darkness was upon the face of the
   workers.
as they spoke with their Group Head saying:
"It is a crock of shit and it stinketh."
 
 
The Group Heads
----------------------------------------------------
And the Group Heads went into their Section
   Heads and sayeth:
"It is a pail of dung and none may abide by the
   odor thereof."
 
 
The Section Heads
----------------------------------------------------
And the Section Heads went into their
   Managers and sayeth unto them:
"It is a container of excrement. And it is very
   strong.
Such that none may abide by it."
 
 
The Managers
----------------------------------------------------
And the Managers went unto their Director and
  sayeth unto him:
"It is a vessel of fertilizer. And none may abide
   by its strength."
 
 
The Director
----------------------------------------------------
And the Director went unto the Vice President
   and sayeth unto him:
"It promoteth growth and is very
   powerful."
 
 
The Vice President
----------------------------------------------------
And the VP went unto the President and sayeth
   unto him:
"This powerful new Plan will actively promote
   the growth.
and efficiency of the Company."
 
 
The Policy
----------------------------------------------------
And the President looked upon the Plan and
  saw
that it was good and the Plan became Policy.
