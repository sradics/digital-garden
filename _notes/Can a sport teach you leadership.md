Can a sport teach you leadership?  
  
â†’ IT TAUGHT ME!  
â†’ How I turned teamwork into leadership  
  
I was 10.  
When I joined a handball team.  
Initially, I played as a goalkeeper.  
Then my coach saw a different potential.  
He asked if I wanted to play on the field.  
I decided to take this huge shift.  
I had to adjust my skills and my mindset.  
Till today I build on this experience.  
  
Handball tought me:  
LEADERSHIP THROUGH TEAMWORK!  
âž  through consistent practice and hard work  
âž  you can turn challenges into opportunities.  
  
To close the gap as field player  
  
â†’ I trained hard five days a week  
â†’ I competed in weekend matches  
â†’ I learned to strategize and collaborate  
â†’ I became team captain and a team leader  
  
âž âž  HARD WORK AND DEDICATION  
turns a challenge into a growth opportunity.  
  
With the right mindset and dedication,  
you can achieve great things.  
  
âž  I led my team to numerous victories  
âž  I developed resilience and accountability  
âž  I gained skills invaluable as a professional  
  
LEADERSHIP THROUGH TEAMWORK!  
â†’ Lead with passion  
â†’ Embrace new challenges  
âž  and youâ€™ll see the results.  
  
What sport or activity taught ONE valuable life lesson?
