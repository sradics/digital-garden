15 people thought they knew how to take notes.

Then they discovered their CAPTURE blind spots...

We explored the core of Building a Second Brain:
â€”â€”â€” Second Brain â€”â€”â€”
A system that turns information chaos into your competitive advantage.

The foundation:
â†’ CAPTURE â†’ ORGANIZE â†’ DISTILL â†’ EXPRESS 
â€”â€”â€”

Every step has its secrets.  
Let's start with CAPTURE:

â€”â€”â€” CAPTURE Reflections â€”â€”â€”

â†’ What are the different sources of information you regularly use?

â†’ How do you decide about relevance?

â†’ How do you balance consumption vs. distraction?
â€”â€”â€”

These reflections led to powerful next steps:
â€”â€”â€” CAPTURE Actions â€”â€”â€”

1. Audit your information diet (most skip this)  

2. Explore that Discovery â‰  Consumption (an eye-opening split!)  

3. Design your capture pipeline (we'll show you how)

â€”â€”â€”

We've just scratched the surface of CAPTURE
The rabbit hole goes much deeper...
