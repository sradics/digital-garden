Reflection:
+ I apply eat the frog often and also couple that with my Todoist task management and flagging that with energy levels
	+ [[Manage your energy, not your time]]
	+ [[Notes from Guide Master your 4 pillars of energy]]
+ 3/3/3 - seems similar for Learn-Reflect-Grow for learning
+ Timeblocking - I'm often already blocking time for e.g. course preparations beforehand in my calendar, even if that event will be just in some weeks. This then reminds me early on and I have already time blocked. I guess this can be combined with 3/3/3
+ Seinfeld - sounds interesting
+ I tried with Pomodoro, also within Obsidian, but actually did not manage to really build a habit
+ Eisenhower Matrix - just a great tool, that I apply unconsciously often. At the same time I did not yet fully integrate it in my routines. I find [[MOC 10K$ framework]] more appealing and integrated that with my Todoist.
