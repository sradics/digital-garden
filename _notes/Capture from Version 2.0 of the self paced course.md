# Capture from Version 2.0 of the self paced course
Notes taken from the version 2.0 of Tiago Forte's self directed course on Building a Second Brain. These notes extend previous course notes and my knowledge around [[MOC Building a 2nd brain]]. 

## Where will a Second Brain help
+ Find anything you've learned in seconds
+ Organize knowledge to move goals forward
+ Save your best thinking
+ Connect ideas across different areas of life
+ Turn work "off" and relax, with a trusted system that keeps track of all the details
+ Spend more time doing the best, most creative work you're capable of

## About Notes
Helps you to recall anything you want to remember to achieve anything your desire.
+ Notes are where I keep m\y most important knowledge
+ A note is a knowledge building block. A discrete unit of information, with my personal view/interpretation.

## A second brain does
+ makes ideas/thoughts concrete
+ turn information into tangible items one can work with
+ it helps to create new associations
+ incubate ideas over time (and combats recency bias)
+ sharpens the perspective and provides supporting material to an argumentation
+ a Second Brain - the collection of all tools I use to interact with my information & knowledge
+ notes apps allow to stay informal and ideal for free form exploration
+ take care that notes are useful to you know
+ sensitivity to resonance ... what is relevant and important to me

## Capture
+ reference to knowledge banks - commonplace books
	+ to inform writing, speaking and conversation
+ knowledge = content 
	+ article highlights, quotes, books, voice memos, meeting notes
	+ internal: sparks of insights, stories, memories, reflections
+ capture when something resonates - make it simple, just capture that in a note
+ personal notes vs organizational notes
	+ have your own Second Brain - individual to yourself
+ when using a Second Brain in an organization
	+ make sure everyone is aligned on the organizing system behind
	+ describe that method
	+ train everyone how to use it
	+ only store shared projects in the shared space
	+ ensure that you only add context when you share. And make sure that sharing is actually worth it. Will it be really used by multiple people?
+ 12 favorite problems - filter for what to capture
	+ What are the questions I've always been interested in?
	+ Start with How/What open ended questions
	+ Let it invoke a state of wonder
	+ helps to cultivate a spirit of discovery


### 12 question prompts
How can I...?
How might we...?
How can my organization...?
How can I help others to...?
How does X relate to Y?
How do I...?
What does it look like to...?
What would be possible if...?
What do I want with...?
What would I do if...?
What would happen if...?
What would have to be true to...?

### 4 Capture criteria (OR connected)
+ Does it inspire me?
+ Is it useful? (statistic, reference)
+ Is this personal? (so connecting a personal moment, that only I can have)
+ Is it surprising? (Did I not already know it.... Does it conflict with my existing point of view)

### Capture toolkit
+ explore youtube transcripts to easier get the main message exported
+ further explore into Voice memo and reasonable pipeline
+ can I forward an eMail to Obsidian?
+ use screenshot and use AI text recognition features
+ capture goal: move towards lowest friction method to get knowledge into your Second Brain
+ don't think too much about organizing at this point

### Organize
+ organize by how actionable and information is, not what kind of information it is
+ PARA is tool independent from the tool
+ Projects - Short term efforts in your work-life that you're working on now
+ Areas - Long term responsibilities you want to manage over time 
+ Topics or interest that may be useful in the future
+ Archives - inactive items from any of the 3 categories (PAR) 
+ Works with an Inbox to manage new arrivals to the system
+ Use the inbox to decouple capturing and organizing of notes
+ Organize when you do have time to organize your notes
	+ ask: How actionable is this?
+ What matters: If I'm actively focussed on something related to those notes
	+ Notes can an should move around PARA
+ Usually resources and archives are of very low maintainance. Projects and Areas should have a bit more love.
