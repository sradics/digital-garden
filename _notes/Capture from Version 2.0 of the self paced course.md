# Capture from Version 2.0 of the self paced course
> [!tip]
> CHASE WHAT EXCITES YOU

Notes taken from the version 2.0 of Tiago Forte's self directed course on Building a Second Brain. These notes extend previous course notes and my knowledge around [[MOC Building a 2nd brain]]. 

## Where will a Second Brain help
+ Find anything you've learned in seconds
+ Organize knowledge to move goals forward
+ Save your best thinking
+ Connect ideas across different areas of life
+ Turn work "off" and relax, with a trusted system that keeps track of all the details
+ Spend more time doing the best, most creative work you're capable of

## About Notes
Helps you to recall anything you want to remember to achieve anything your desire.
+ Notes are where I keep m\y most important knowledge
+ A note is a knowledge building block. A discrete unit of information, with my personal view/interpretation.

## A second brain does
+ makes ideas/thoughts concrete
+ turn information into tangible items one can work with
+ it helps to create new associations
+ incubate ideas over time (and combats recency bias)
+ sharpens the perspective and provides supporting material to an argumentation
+ a Second Brain - the collection of all tools I use to interact with my information & knowledge
+ notes apps allow to stay informal and ideal for free form exploration
+ take care that notes are useful to you know
+ sensitivity to resonance ... what is relevant and important to me

## Capture - What resonates
+ reference to knowledge banks - commonplace books
	+ to inform writing, speaking and conversation
+ knowledge = content 
	+ article highlights, quotes, books, voice memos, meeting notes
	+ internal: sparks of insights, stories, memories, reflections
+ capture when something resonates - make it simple, just capture that in a note
+ personal notes vs organizational notes
	+ have your own Second Brain - individual to yourself
+ when using a Second Brain in an organization
	+ make sure everyone is aligned on the organizing system behind
	+ describe that method
	+ train everyone how to use it
	+ only store shared projects in the shared space
	+ ensure that you only add context when you share. And make sure that sharing is actually worth it. Will it be really used by multiple people?
+ 12 favorite problems - filter for what to capture
	+ What are the questions I've always been interested in?
	+ Start with How/What open ended questions
	+ Let it invoke a state of wonder
	+ helps to cultivate a spirit of discovery


### 12 question prompts
How can I...?
How might we...?
How can my organization...?
How can I help others to...?
How does X relate to Y?
How do I...?
What does it look like to...?
What would be possible if...?
What do I want with...?
What would I do if...?
What would happen if...?
What would have to be true to...?

### 4 Capture criteria (OR connected)
+ Does it inspire me?
+ Is it useful? (statistic, reference)
+ Is this personal? (so connecting a personal moment, that only I can have)
+ Is it surprising? (Did I not already know it.... Does it conflict with my existing point of view)

### Capture toolkit
+ explore youtube transcripts to easier get the main message exported
+ further explore into Voice memo and reasonable pipeline
+ can I forward an eMail to Obsidian?
+ use screenshot and use AI text recognition features
+ capture goal: move towards lowest friction method to get knowledge into your Second Brain
+ don't think too much about organizing at this point

## Organize - for actionability
+ organize by how actionable and information is, not what kind of information it is
+ PARA is tool independent from the tool
+ Projects - Short term efforts in your work-life that you're working on now
+ Areas - Long term responsibilities you want to manage over time 
+ Topics or interest that may be useful in the future
+ Archives - inactive items from any of the 3 categories (PAR) 
+ Works with an Inbox to manage new arrivals to the system
+ Use the inbox to decouple capturing and organizing of notes
+ Organize when you do have time to organize your notes
	+ ask: How actionable is this?
+ What matters: If I'm actively focussed on something related to those notes
	+ Notes can an should move around PARA
+ Usually resources and archives are of very low maintainance. Projects and Areas should have a bit more love.

## Distill - your notes to reveal their essence
### Importance of Discovery for the Notes
+ What is in the notes?
+ How to access the most actionable information?
+ Key is to distill message down to the key points and action steps
+ each layer of highlighting should contain between 10-20% of the previous layer
+ highlight with a purpose in mind. And often to be done best before you need to apply that knowledge

## Express - yourself through your work in the smallest useful way you can
+ Don't wait to share what you know
+ Express early, more frequently and in smaller chunks
+ Test what works and gather feedback
+ Intermediate packets - small pieces of work in progress

### Types of Intermediate packets
+ distilled notes
+ outtakes - materials from past projects that did not make it into past projects
+ works-in-progress - produced during past projects
+ final deliverables from past projects
+ documents created by others
+ cite your sources and give credit

### Benefits
+ Become interruption-proof
+ Make progress in short spans of time - match time available
+ Get Feedback more often
+ Execute entire projects buy just putting together previous work

### Retrival methods
+ Search
+ Browsing through PARA - this way you create serendepity and working with contextual clues
+ Tags
	+ as general structuring method tags require to high cognitive load to add this to each note
	+ especially good when you want to gather, connect and synthesize notes on the fly
+ Serendipity
+ AI applied to my notes

## Application
### Divergence and Convergence
+ alternating back & forth between these two states
+ divergence
	+ open widely - time to wonder without contraints
	+ CAPTURE and ORGANIZE
+ convergance
	+ project management
	+ take decisions and select the best ones
	+ DISTILL and EXPRESS
### 3 Essential Second Brain techniques
To help you through the pitfall of convergence.

#### The Archipelago of Ideas
This technique revolves around creating **a ==chain of inspiring quotes, ideas, or points==** that serve as the foundation of your work. By already having these 'islands of insight', you're equipped with **stepping stones that guide your execution**, turning a daunting task into an approachable process.  

A variant of Outlining.

#### The Hemingway Bridge
Named after the famous writer Ernest Hemingway, this method focuses on **==ending each work session with a clear understanding of the next step==**. This strategy lets you **use yesterday's momentum to fuel today's work**, **eliminating** the **friction of starting from scratch.**

+ write out intention for next work session
    
#### Dial Down the Scope
Realize the value of **==focusing on the core==**, **high-impact elements** of your project. By doing so, you can achieve the most value in a fraction of the time. The **non-essential parts can be stored for future use**, reducing regrets about wasted efforts.

+ deliver the vast majority of the value in a fraction of the time it would require to build full scope
+ save removed parts e.g. to resources or archives

### Project Kickoff Checklist
40-60'
+ Write initial notes in a new project folder
	+ Braindump of all thoughts around that project, just as a note
+ check relates folders for notes or tags
+ use search
+ move notes into the new project folder
+ create an outline based on the notes moved to the project folder

### Project Completion Checklist
10-30'
To capture assets from finished projects to give a jumpstart to a new project
+ Mark project as complete
+ Review project goals 
+ Review intermediate packets and move notes in your Second Brain
+ Move project folder to archive
+ Add current status to *cancelled* or *postponed* projects

### Weekly review checklist
+ every 3..10 days - just make it a repeatable practice
+ clear eMail inbox
+ check calendar
	+ last few weeks for follow ups
	+ upcoming weeks
+ clear desktop
+ clean notes inbox (that was likely filled by the previous steps)
	+ do that with light capturing touch! Not yet refine it... wait for when you need it really
+ refine task list
	+ clear to done
	+ plan next week
