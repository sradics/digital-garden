# [[Catch Thoughts Fast to not lose them]]

The 3-second window that determines your creative fate  
  
â†’ Ideas are fleeting: They appear briefly, then fade away.  
  
A missed opportunity, just happened this morning again:  
  
â†’ I had a thought for a new writing topic  
â†’ But I wasn't intentional enough to grab it  
â†’ I got distracted by switching browser windows.  
  
âž  Idea lost, unable to retrieve it  
  
I wish I could always catch these sparks of inspiration.  
  
Sometimes we win,  
sometimes we literally lose, right?  
  
Today was a wake-up call:  
âž  Follow through with INTENTION  
  
Usually, I activate my idea-catch-system:  
  
â†’ I talk it out in VoicePal  
(My usage of Voicepal: [https://lnkd.in/eqhR4ugf](https://lnkd.in/eqhR4ugf))  
  
â†’ I jot it down with Spark-Remark-Relate (SRR)  
(SRR details: [https://lnkd.in/eX-wfw8q](https://lnkd.in/eX-wfw8q))  
  
â†’ I add it to my Todoist "Topics to Write About" list  
  
â‡¢ It's 134 tasks strong now  
â†’ My shield against the blank page  
  
(No Blank Page: [https://lnkd.in/g359xaig](https://lnkd.in/g359xaig))  
  
My system's aim:  
Shorten the gap between idea spark and capture  
  
But I've learned:  
Tools aren't enough â†’ I need to add INTENTION  
  
I must commit to immediate action when inspiration strikes.  
  
Do you remember such situations too?  
  
What is ONE way of catching the thought that works for you?
