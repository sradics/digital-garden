ðŸ’¡How I capture my Ideas, instead of losing them

My ideas often vanished as quickly as they appeared.Â 
Later, I was annoyed that I hadn't captured my idea right away.
Thatâ€™s why I've simplified my approach to capturing thoughts immediately.Â 

Here are my top 5 ways:
â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾
â†³ Visual idea? A quick picture does the trick
â†³ Quick phone note (any simple notes app will do)
â†³ Web pages I need? Forwarded to Matter, to read-laterÂ 
â†³ Longer thought on the go? Voice memo with Just Press Record
â†³ Tasks go straight to my Todoist task manager (available on all devices)
â†³ At my desk: Longer thoughts become fleeting notes in my Obsidian note-taking app.

My captured thoughts then become part of my Second Brain:
â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾
âœª New projects
âœª Project-related tasks in my Task Manager
âœª Notes connected to my are of responsibilities
âœª Permanent notes for term insights to reference later

I make it super easy to add a new thought. Â 
And I work with a semi-automated flow from the idea to my Second Brain.

I use Matter to automatically send highlights to Obsidian and a central Google Drive toÂ 
easily convert notes, transcribed memos, and key pictures into my Obsidian system.

How do you capture ideas? Curious to learn about your approach!

## Content preparation

I lost thoughts, but now I capture them instead

Often new ideas, solutions, things to remember appear and we lost them a minute later because we did not catch it right away. 

I simplified my approach to capture thoughts. Here are 5 ways:
+ I immediately take a note on my phone. A simple notes app is just fine.
+ Tasks I immediately add in my Todoist task manager, available on all devices
+ Web pages I forward to Matter, my read later center
+ Often just taking a picture might connect to the idea
+ On the way and having a longer thought - I record a voice memo using Just Press Record
+ At my desk and having a longer thought - I create a fleeting note in my note taking app Obsidian

I regularly process these captured thoughts and they become part of my Second Brain, either as:
+ a new project
+ a note for my areas of responsibility
+ a long term new insights that becomes a permanent note I can refer to later on
+ a task, connected to a project

The key to all approaches: 
+ make it as easy as possible to immediately add a thought 
+ (semi) automate the flow from having a thought to adding it in your thought processing engine. 

Some insights to my automations:
+ all items captured with Matter, every week I scan through, highlight most important aspects and these highlights are automatically important in my Second Brain center Obsidian
+ I add notes, transcribed voice memos, important pictures taken to a central Google Driven that I can automatically convert to notes in my Obsidian

How do you capture your ideas? Curious to learn about further approaches.
