I was trapped in an expert's perspective again.

â†’ Yesterday's wake-up call about AI assistants

â€”â€”â€”

A friend saw my AI assistant suite - tools for productivity, goal setting, exploring ideas, working with a Second Brain.

His question stopped me cold:

"What is an assistant? Isn't that just ChatGPT?"

â€”â€”â€”

Here's what I realized:

I was so deep in the weeds, I forgot to zoom out.

The difference between ChatGPT and an AI assistant isn't obvious until you see it in action.

â€”â€”â€”

Think of it this way:

â†’ You read a book and take notes â†’ You work with those learnings for years â†’ You reach mastery level on that topic â†’ You write down all your insights and experiences

Now imagine giving all that context to something that can: â†’ Read your material instantly â†’ Answer questions about it â†’ Combine insights with other knowledge â†’ Follow specific instructions on how to work

That's an AI assistant.

â€”â€”â€”

The key difference?

ChatGPT has broad knowledge but no YOUR context.

An AI assistant has YOUR unique context PLUS access to powerful language models.

â€”â€”â€”

When it comes to following structured workflows, assistants really shine.

They know not just what to do, but in what sequence to achieve your specific outcome.

â€”â€”â€”

Which serves you better for specialized topics?

ChatGPT with general knowledge, or an assistant with your years of experience baked in?

The answer depends on how unique your context is.

But for most specialized work, the assistant wins every time.

â€”â€”â€”

What knowledge could you turn into an assistant to serve you (and others)?
