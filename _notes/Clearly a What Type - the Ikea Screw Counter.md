I admit, I count IKEA screws.  
  
â†’ The surprising link between furniture assembly and learning mastery  
  
When I buy that IKEA furniture, I admit that I read the instructions carefully.  
I also sort the materials - screws, stems, frames.  
I even count them.  
  
Instead of jumping to action fast, I better prepare.  
  
This methodical approach to IKEA assembly reveals something interesting about how I learn. I understood that these are characteristics of a WHAT-Learner.  
  
I learn best by:  
â†’ Working with facts and data  
â†’ Looking at cause and effect  
â†’ Thinking through ideas  
  
I need to understand how everything connects.  
(That's why I read the manual...)  
  
At the same time, I know my blind spots  
â†’ Getting lost in theory without purpose  
â†’ Postponing actual practice  
â†’ Missing the bigger picture  
  
(Reading the instructions does not build the furniture...)  
  
Understanding my Learning Type was a breakthrough.  
  
Now I can tailor my learning to best support my favored approach.  
  
I save time, reduce cognitive load and learn with joy.  
  
I strengthen my approach by borrowing from the other 3 learning types:  
â†’ Taking action instead of just learning  
â†’ Extending impact beyond silos  
â†’ Creating tangible outcomes  
  
The result:  
A perfectly assembled wardrobe that fits both my room and my needs.
