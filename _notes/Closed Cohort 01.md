## Content preparation

After delivering C01 with breakthrough results

and 47 hours of curriculum refinement,

I've enhanced our 9-week system:
â†’ 9 Live training sessions, 2h each
â†’ 8 Exploration hours for deep dive
â†’ 10 highly tailored AI assistants you can apply right away

Cohort #01 delivered to 22 participant ... 

Ready for your summer learning transformation? 
You can join Cohort #02 this July.

While similar programs cost 2000â‚¬+, this refined system delivers at 750â‚¬.

P.S.
Limited to 25 seats. 18 still available.
(and I did not yet start with detailed marketing...)
