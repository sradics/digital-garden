After delivering C01 with breakthrough results  
  
and 47 hours of curriculum refinement,  
  
I've enhanced our 9-week system:  
â†’ 9 Live training sessions, 2h each  
â†’ 8 Exploration hours for deep dive  
â†’ 10 highly tailored AI assistants you can apply right away  
  
Cohort #01 delivered to 22 participant ...  
  
Ready for your summer learning transformation?  
You can join Cohort #02 this July.  
  
While similar programs cost 2000â‚¬+, this refined system delivers at 750â‚¬.  
  
P.S.  
Limited to 25 seats. 18 still available.  
(and I did not yet start with detailed marketing...)
