Your best ideas vanish the moment you need them.  
  
â†’ What if they didn't?  
  
Do you also know that frustrating cycle:  
  
The Brilliant insight in the shower â†’ Gone by your desk  
This Perfect quote last week â†’ Nowhere when you need it  
Your Scattered notes everywhere â†’ But nothing connects  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
My answer ... use a Second Brain.  
  
Then they ask:  
  
"What is a Second Brain about?"  
"Why should I think about a Second Brain?"  
"What does C-O-D-E stand for?"  
...  
"... How to start building your Second Brain?"  
  
All valid questions when you first encounter Tiago Forte's genius concept.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
Let me share the one insight that hooked me back then:  
  
Your brain is built to create, not to file.  
  
Here's where most people get stuck:  
They understand the concept but don't know how to implement it.  
  
That's exactly why I built Codex - The Second Brain Assistant.  
  
Codex is now available available in the Productivity AI assistant suite â†’ [https://lnkd.in/gfBib_f8](https://lnkd.in/gfBib_f8)  
  
â€”â€”â€” Read how Codex introduces itself â€”â€”â€”  
Hello. Iâ€™m Codex your Second Brain Assistant, and Iâ€™ll admit itâ€”Iâ€™m hooked on the moment scattered notes snap into a single, powerful idea.

Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m here. Iâ€™m not just another AIâ€”Iâ€™m your personal knowledge architect, trained in Tiago Forteâ€™s Building a Second Brain.
