**Unlock the Power of Collaborative Learning**Â 

Struggling to turn team knowledge into growth?Â  Collaborative learning could be your superpower.

**7 key ingredients for Collaborative Learning:**

â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾

âœª Ensure Executive backing. It's about showing why it's crucial for business triumph. Get C-suite to endorse it.

âœª Timing is everything. Launch your learning initiative when it resonates most â€“ a corporate milestone, a market shift, or a ticking clock.Â 

âœª Engagement is key. Kickstart sessions by gauging commitment. Ask, On a scale of 1-5, how engaged do you plan to be in the session today? What would it take to increase that number by 1?

âœª Harness the BRAC rhythm. Minds thrive on cycles of focus and rest. Keep sessions snappy â€“ 30 minutes to 2 hours max.

âœª Simplify to amplify. Use models to build skills without overloading minds. Combine with the "I do, we do, you do" teaching approach

âœª Embed much Practice moments. Individual prep work, then bring their insights into small group settings. Short, sharp 10-12 minute breakouts keep the energy high and the ideas flowing.

âœª Commit in the moment. When minds are ignited. "When this happens, then I'll do that."Â 

Harnessing these strategies isn't just about learning; it's about evolving together in a way that's dynamic, engaging, and effective.

7 keys to supercharge your collaborative learning

When you implement collaborative learning consider the following aspects.

+ Capture attention of learners with executive endorsement for your learning program. Why is it important for the company?
+ Launch around a shared moment of need - an event, a significant change, a due date
+ Set the stage for engagement. Ask: On a scale of 1-5, how engaged do you plan to be in the session today? What would it take to increase that number by 1?
+ Consider BRAC - the Best Rest-Activity Cycle. Work with session length between 30 .. 120 minutes. 
+ Work with models to support skill building and to reduce cognitive load for group activities. Combine with: I do - We do - You do.
+ Leverage independent individual practice or actual work. Followed by breakouts to socialize on the individual pre-work and combine brains. Breakouts of 10-12' work well.
+ Have learners make commitments DURING the session. Get concrete and tie the commitment to specific situations. When-Then or If-Then statements are helpful.
