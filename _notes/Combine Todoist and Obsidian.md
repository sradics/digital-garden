⚡ Faster, Smarter, Better: Todoist meets Obsidian ⚡  
(a powerful combination of task management and personal knowledge management)  
  
I use Todoist for managing my tasks.  
I use Obsidian for my personal knowledge management.  
Both tools are core components of my Second Brain.  
But they weren’t integrated yet 🤔  
  
Inspired by [Ingmar Krusch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ingmar-krusch/), I explored ways to combine both tools.  
I discovered the TODOIST SYNC Plugin for Obsidian.  
  
After installing and experimenting with it,  
I implemented two immediate use cases:  
———  
→ Task Creation: I create tasks while working in Obsidian.  
The tasks you create link to your corresponding note.  
  
→ Project Management:  
I enriched my Map of Content for Projects with a list of open tasks.  
Imported from Todoist.  
(Learn more about Maps of Content in my previous post: [https://lnkd.in/en3wh47B](https://lnkd.in/en3wh47B)).  
  
I created a template for the Todoist Filter.  
⏱️🛠️ With that template you can embed task lists for new projects in 10 seconds.  

🌟Immediate Benefits:  
———  
→ Faster Linking:  
Link your notes and tasks with one command, eliminating manual steps  
  
→ Centralized Tasks:  
Manage in one place, display wherever you need.  
Follow the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle.  
  
→ Less Context Switching:  
You can switch between tasks and notes without losing focus.  
  
How do you manage your tasks?  
Have you integrated your task manager yet?

🔄 Integrating Todoist and Obsidian for a Seamless Workflow 🔄

I use Todoist for managing my tasks and Obsidian for my personal knowledge management. These tools are core components of my Second Brain, but they weren’t integrated—until now.

Inspired by Ingmar, I explored ways to combine both tools and discovered the TODOIST SYNC Obsidian Plugin. After installing and experimenting with it, I implemented two immediate use cases:

→ Project Management: I enriched my Map of Content for Projects with a list of open tasks, directly imported from Todoist. (Learn more about Maps of Content in my previous post: Maps of Content)
→ Task Embedding: I created a template for the Todoist Filter, allowing me to embed task lists for new projects in just 10 seconds.
→ Task Creation: Now, I can create tasks while working in Obsidian, and the newly created tasks automatically link to the corresponding note.

Immediate Benefits:

→ Faster Linking: 
Link your notes and tasks with one command, eliminating manual steps
→ Centralized Tasks: 
Manage in one place, display wherever you need. 
Follow the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle.
→ Less Context Switching: 
You can seamlessly switch between tasks and notes without losing focus

How do you manage your tasks? Have you integrated your task manager yet?
Let’s share our experiences and explore ways to enhance productivity together!

I use Todoist for managing my tasks.
I use Obsidian for my personal knowledge management. 
Todoist and Obsidian are both core components of my Second Brain.

But they were not yet integrated. Based on an impulse by Ingmar I looked for a way to combine both tools. And I found the TODOIST SYNC Obsidian Plugin.

Installed, played with it and implemented 2 immediate use cases:
- I enriched my Map of Content for Projects with a list of open tasks. The lust is directly imported from Todoist (details about Maps of Content - https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_i-use-3-powerful-approaches-to-organize-all-activity-7203651769107689473--5Hw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
- To make that easy for next projects, I just created a Template for the Todoist Filter. Embedding the task list for next project can now be done in 10 seconds.
- I can now create tasks while working in Obsidian. The newly created tasks automatically links to my corresponding note. 

Immediate benefit
+ Less context switching
+ Faster linking of Notes and Tasks. Took me some manual steps before and can now be done with one command.
+ Tasks at one place, displayed in many. Following the Don't Repeat Yourself principle

Did you already integrate your task manager?
