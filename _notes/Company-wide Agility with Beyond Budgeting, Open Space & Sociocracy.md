“Make information open for self-regulation, innovation, learning, and control because only informed people can make adequate decisions.” The heading of this principle calls already for transparency. — location: [482](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=482) ^ref-34149

---
Circles exist because their participants have a common aim. An aim is a product or service that the customer understands and is attracted to. — location: [608](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=608) ^ref-60960

---
Thus, a circle will soon cease to exist if there is no customer focus because there is no longer a reason for the circle to exist. — location: [609](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=609) ^ref-9245

---
circle refers to the team of people who are participating in the system that delivers value to the external (or internal) customer. — location: [610](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=610) ^ref-38786

---
Each circle is responsible for planning its own development and the development of each of its members. — location: [614](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=614) ^ref-587

---
Double-linking means that each circle elects a representative (someone not the boss) to sit in the next higher circle and participate fully in the policy decisions of that circle. — location: [620](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=620) ^ref-41718

---
Double-linking is a way to build feedback into an organizational structure. — location: [621](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=621) ^ref-36896

---
A consent decision is not one that you unite with or agree with but one that you can accept (or tolerate). — location: [627](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=627) ^ref-12363

---
You consent if you have no reasoned and paramount objection to a policy proposal. — location: [628](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=628) ^ref-12876

---
For consensus, the typical question is if everyone is in favor of the decision, whereas for consent the question is if everyone “is able and willing to execute the decision” — location: [633](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=633) ^ref-56667

---
emerges in a self-organizing way from the circle. — location: [638](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=638) ^ref-8199

It makes us sensitive to out-of-balance power arrangements. — location: [642](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=642) ^ref-41272

Self-organization occurs only when everyone is empowered and attuned to customer needs. — location: [642](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=642) ^ref-50235

“Because it boosts the level cooperation amongst all stakeholders at all levels of an organization.” Many organizations suffer from an ‘us versus them’ culture, from ‘saying yes but not doing it’ and from ‘complaining without taking responsibility for the problem’. — location: [646](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=646) ^ref-29366

In its original software context, this value means that an agile team has to find its own specific process (and improving it over — location: [684](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=684) ^ref-62353

thereby helping to create business value — location: [685](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=685) ^ref-31337

---
for the customer. Thus, processes and tools have to support people and their interactions and not the other way around. Companies not using agile tend to have standard processes and tools that prevail regardless of the team needs. However, for a company-wide context, we believe that this value must reflect the need for the whole company to operate as a complex, emergent system. A complex system can only be guided by people (sometimes referred to “alignment for autonomy”). Tools do not emerge by themselves. To operate as a complex system the company must foster self-organization throughout. — location: [685](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=685) ^ref-2860

---
Transparency means ability to access information and not necessarily “clarity.” — location: [696](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=696) ^ref-39073

---
Transparency must be in place company-wide - not just within a team using an agile approach. — location: [697](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=697) ^ref-50854

---
In a company-wide context, it means finding imaginative ways to keep in constant touch with customers to ensure that your product or services truly meet their needs. — location: [700](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=700) ^ref-22497

---
Everyone must develop a deep understanding of their customers regardless of their role in the company. — location: [703](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=703) ^ref-59266

---
Therefore, continuous learning is fundamental for company-wide Agility. — location: [709](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=709) ^ref-47410

---
Self-organization, transparency, constant customer focus, and continuous learning can “thrive a company.” They enable company-wide Agility. — location: [716](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=716) ^ref-50637

mindset is the values, beliefs, and principles you hold that guide your actions in a situation. — location: [722](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=722) ^ref-46859

---
An agile mindset means you value the collaboration and feedback in an agile team. You believe that small steps and frequent checking of progress will help. You believe that people collaborating together can deliver a terrific product. You use the agile and lean principles of collaboration, delivery, and transparency to guide your work. — location: [723](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=723) ^ref-7898

“self-organization” we mean that a system (e.g. a team) does “it’s own thing purposefully” without external control (see PrincipiaCybernetica). — location: [772](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=772) ^ref-12338

---
With people, self-organization seems to require that everybody is equivalent and has the opportunity to contribute something. — location: [773](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=773) ^ref-45268

If the capability, responsibility and task are separated — location: [785](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=785) ^ref-63274

(some to the manager some to the “managee”), self-organization cannot happen (see Emery & Trist). — location: [785](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=785) ^ref-8413

---
Another challenge is that for a group to self-organize, every voice in the group needs to be heard. — location: [786](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=786) ^ref-5103

Trust people with freedom to act; don’t punish everyone if someone — location: [792](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=792) ^ref-61070

The right, but also the more demanding response is to have that very firm talk with those involved, and let it have the necessary consequences. Trust is not about being soft.” — location: [798](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=798) ^ref-20207

---
Values guide more surely than any rules and regulations because they guide the whole person. Rules and regulations can only set a framework while values can guide from moment to moment. — location: [803](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=803) ^ref-30725

---
Or in other words, if a group of people doesn’t have a common goal they can’t self-organize, because there isn’t anything they can self-organize “around”. And, — location: [806](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=806) ^ref-32516

---
Open Space relies on self-selecting teams to work together — location: [817](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=817) ^ref-37611

---
Because individuals are the very best managers of their own experience, learning and contributing, — location: [819](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=819) ^ref-10451

---
and a group of equivalent people need a common aim, the pressure of a customer’s needs, to self-organize their work. — location: [828](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=828) ^ref-24062

---
Rather than a single command connection, abstract to concrete (“top to bottom”), there is a second power system that also creates a flow of power from concrete to abstract (“bottom to top”). — location: [840](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=840) ^ref-42963

---
Each level is connected to the next level above and the next level below with two people, not one. — location: [843](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=843) ^ref-11151

Agile links self-organization to trust in the individuals and their interactions. — location: [847](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=847) ^ref-30422

The retrospective is the usual place where the adjustment of the process is happening. — location: [849](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=849) ^ref-47952

---
The delivery of a complete product (or complete functionality or user story) serves as a common goal for the team, which is another prerequisite for self-organization. — location: [854](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=854) ^ref-23615

---
but it’s easy to lose sight of the principles and become obsessed with the system itself when there are so many rules in the constitution. — location: [895](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=895) ^ref-10972

---
Self-organization is sparked by a common aim, equivalence, and/or shared values. These define the container, thus the aim and value have an impact on the width or narrowness of the container. — location: [918](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=918) ^ref-35006

---
The container is stronger if the aim is based on the customer’s needs because the customer brings in an outside pressure or force that drives the self-organization phenomena. — location: [919](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=919) ^ref-23445

---
The variety in perspectives must be balanced with the common aim. — location: [921](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=921) ^ref-35126

By “transparency” we mean making information accessible so that people can make knowledgeable decisions. — location: [930](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=930) ^ref-2191

For example, transparency is necessary for continuous learning and constant customer focus. — location: [931](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=931) ^ref-50415

“bounded by transparency.” (see Herman). Transparency is a trouble detector, because when you implement it, existing problems (often long existing) can no longer be hidden. — location: [944](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=944) ^ref-5725

Because any issue or opportunity of importance can be raised in Organizational Open Space, — location: [972](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=972) ^ref-16867

Someone who hides information can manipulate and control others, and that violates the need for equivalence, discussed under self-organization. — location: [978](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=978) ^ref-55023

A composite definition might be: transparency is a structure that reliably — location: [993](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=993) ^ref-64800

Customers are typically the persons or institutions who receive products or services from the company. — location: [1001](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=1001) ^ref-44620

So there is a paradox: there are actually two customers - the company itself and external customers. The trick is to synthesize the interests of both kinds of customer using a win-win approach. — location: [1009](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0841298GC&location=1009) ^ref-13677
