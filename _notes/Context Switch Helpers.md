How many tabs open? 20+ 🤪

→ this way I got my focus back
→ Context switching happens
→ Relax ... and do it smarter

I use TOOLS TO SWITCH contexts super FAST.

Two examples that help me daily:

1‍⃣ gettoby - for managing my browser tabs

→ Load all Browser Windows I need for one topic
→ Lower cognitive load to remember sources
→ Reduce distractions

———

2‍⃣ Obsidian Workspaces
→ For fast switching project contexts
→ I load certain notes and context by project

As an example:
For my daily LinkedIn, my workspace shows
↳ my note about formatting
↳ my main writing note
↳ ready to start fast

———

Two small tweaks, resulting in:
→ Focus ➠ clean, distraction free
→ Reduced cognitive load ➠ more ENERGY
→ Speed ➠ win back TIME for important stuff

Whats ONE way you manage your workspace?
