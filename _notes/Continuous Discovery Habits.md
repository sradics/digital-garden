That means rather than defining your success by the code that you ship (your output), you define success as the value that code creates for your customers and for your business (the outcomes). — location: [216](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B094PVB97X&location=216) ^ref-47555

I encourage teams to visualize it using an opportunity solution tree (OST). — location: [341](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B094PVB97X&location=341) ^ref-15400

---
The root of the tree is your desired outcome—the business need that reflects how your team can create business value. Next is the opportunity space. These are the customer needs, pain points, and desires that, if addressed, will drive your desired outcome. Below the opportunity space is the solution space. This is where we’ll visually depict the solutions we are exploring. Below the solution space are assumption tests. This is how we’ll evaluate which solutions will help us best create customer value in a way that drives business value. — location: [344](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B094PVB97X&location=344) ^ref-32868

We forget to ask, “How else might we solve this problem?” — location: [364](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B094PVB97X&location=364) ^ref-1283

However, most of the decisions that we make in discovery are reversible decisions. — location: [410](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B094PVB97X&location=410) ^ref-37528

This gives us the luxury of moving quickly, rather than falling prey to analysis paralysis. — location: [411](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B094PVB97X&location=411) ^ref-51016

and found that the best designers evolve the problem space and the solution space together. — location: [420](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B094PVB97X&location=420) ^ref-18672

As they explore potential solutions, they learn more about the problem, and, as they learn more about the problem, new solutions become possible. — location: [422](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B094PVB97X&location=422) ^ref-3269

“Based on my current understanding of my customer, I thought this solution would work. It didn’t. What did I misunderstand about my customer?” — location: [425](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B094PVB97X&location=425) ^ref-20705

If our opportunity space is too shallow, it can guide us to do more customer interviews. — location: [435](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B094PVB97X&location=435) ^ref-12992

If we aren’t considering enough solutions for our target opportunity, we can hold an ideation session. — location: [436](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B094PVB97X&location=436) ^ref-5123

---
the best teams also work bottom-up. They use their assumption tests to help them evaluate their solutions and evolve the opportunity space. — location: [439](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B094PVB97X&location=439) ^ref-44166

First, they share too much information—entire interview recordings or pages and pages of notes without any synthesis—expecting stakeholders to do the discovery work with them. — location: [451](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B094PVB97X&location=451) ^ref-3837

Or second, they share too little of what they are learning, only highlighting their conclusions, often cherry-picking the research that best supports those conclusions. — location: [452](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B094PVB97X&location=452) ^ref-61237

A well-constructed opportunity solution tree does exactly this. — location: [456](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B094PVB97X&location=456) ^ref-12157

When sharing your discovery work with stakeholders, you can use your tree to first remind them of your desired outcome. — location: [456](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B094PVB97X&location=456) ^ref-38598

However, we can increase the accountability of each team by assigning a metric that is relevant to their own work. — location: [543](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B094PVB97X&location=543) ^ref-53739

However, if they are assigned a product outcome, they alone are responsible for driving results. — location: [549](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B094PVB97X&location=549) ^ref-65225

The key is to use traction metrics only when you are optimizing a solution and not when the intent is to discover new solutions. — location: [568](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B094PVB97X&location=568) ^ref-4544

Researchers have found that teams that set specific, challenging goals outperform teams who don’t. Challenging goals create focus, inspire effort and persistence, and help to surface relevant organizational knowledge. However, there are some caveats. The team has to believe that they can achieve the goal, and they need to be committed to the goal, further supporting the idea that teams need to be involved in defining their own outcomes. Teams also need continuous feedback on their progress toward their goal, supporting the argument that goals should be measurable.17 — location: [599](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B094PVB97X&location=599) ^ref-59427
