Do you still work with Windows 3.11?  
  
â†’ What works, works ... let's not change  
â†’ Although much better options exist  
â†’ And one knows that this will crash  
â†’ Invisible urgency lulls us  
â†’ This is INERTIA at play  
  
No way you, say. I upgraded decades ago!  
âž  Congratulations!  
  
I guess it was because:  
â†’ It is faster, more secure  
â†’ You get the job done faster  
â†’ You can do so much more (and have fun)  
  
You know where I'm heading, right?  
You have this feeling 'he got me'?  
I'm sorry to bring the message!  
Actually I'm not really sorry.  
  
Because you can change it!  
It's a decision, sure! It takes effort!  

âž  LEARN HOW TO LEARN (with me)  
â†³ I help you rediscover the joy in learning  
â†³ You upgrade to "Mac OS Sonoma 14.6.1"  
  
Ready to break through inertia?  
I get your back, my friend ... reach out.
