From 450 Comments to 2 Conversions  
  
â†’ How I Tripled Results â†“  
  
Do you write on LinkedIn to win clients?  
  
Here's my behind-the-scenes reality few share..  
  
This week's experiment: Learning Styles Discovery Workshop  
I tested a multifold LinkedIn strategy:  
Posts + DMs + Connections  
  
My insights:  
  
While post engagement soared, direct conversions stayed low:  
â†’ 8,200 followers, 9 posts, 800 likes, 450 comments  
â†’ 2 direct conversions.Â Â (mmmh??!!)  
  
My Personal outreach strategy delivered:  
â†’ DM'd 92 engaged connections  
â†’ 27 responses (30% rate)  
â†’ 6 workshop participants  
â†’ 5 feedback calls  
  
Key Learning:  
âž  8,200 followers look impressive  
âž Â But genuine connections drive real results  
âž  Getting into DMs matters.  

Want the full strategy breakdown? â†’ [https://lnkd.in/eEcAiRMr](https://lnkd.in/eEcAiRMr)  
  
â€”â€” P.S. But also consider what not to do with Outreach!! â€”â€”
