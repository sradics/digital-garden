Just do it!

[[Course Material#Working with Failure]]

## Understanding Self-Doubt
+ we give that too much power 
+ if self doubt becomes a habit we need to change that
+ look self-doubt in the eyes - thanks for the interest - and let it go
+ Doubt is just a question to an unknown:
	+ Are you sure you can do that?
	+ Are you sure this will work out?
	+ Is that the decision you really want to make?
+ comes often from emotional part of our brains
+ the voice in our head is often talking rubbish .. trying to keep us safe
+ it is a distortion of our reality
+ what I feel I can do and what I can do are two different things
+ often also used as an excuse
+ your limits told are not your limits
+ find a way to interrupt the self doubt spiral

Reflect our your self-doubt:
* What is one thing you've achieved in the past, that your self-doubt told you couldn't do?
* What is your self-doubt currently telling you you can't do, in relation to the confidence goal you set earlier?

+ positive thinking is a conscious choice
+ we have control over our thoughts .. we need to be intentional to focus on the good things in our life
+ break habit of automatic negative thoughts
	+ thoughts are not the truth! ... it is just a thought
	+ question .. why this though is coming? And is that helpful
	+ what would be a better thought instead?
+ monitor your self talk and bring that to the surface
+ they are just thoughts until you belief them
+ the more you chose thoughts the more you will create positive outcomes for yourself

## Practical techniques to overcome negative thinking
+ What you say and think determines the reality of your life
+ thoughts creates a field of reference
+ we have a tendency to try to be right on our thoughts and also to find evidence that proves that
	+ this also applies to negative thought
+ it starts with your initial thoughts ... and you chose these thoughts
+ write down negative thought ... AND I know this is not true

### T:Reframe your thoughts
+ Identify a negative thought: 
	+ The negative thought I have is ...
	+ and I know that is not true
	+ My new empowering thought is

> [!example]
> *The negative thought I have is* that I feel like I don't know what I'm doing at work.
> **And I know this is NOT true.**
> *My new empowering thought is* that I am an extremely capable and competent employee.

+ they are often thinking about you. And they don't see through your lense
+ There is not opinion that matters more than yours when it comes to your own life
+ IN MY OPINION
### What we really fear is failing publicly
+ this often stops us from trying
+ think about "presenting on a desert island" to conquer that thought
+ How are THEY anyway
### They are not on the Court
+ You are playing your game on the court. Not them!
+ It doesn't matter what OTHER people think... ALL that matters is what YOU think and that YOU'RE on the court playing the game.
+ They are not thinking about YOU! Nobody cares that much about you. They much more care about themselves (and mirror their thoughts)

## Practical techniques to Care Less What Others Think
### Focus on your personal best
+ check in on what you want to belief
+ stop comparing to other woman (you don't know their full story) - but compare to yourself
	+ and learn whom you are comparing to atm

"Everyone is a genius.
But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a then it will live its whole life believing it is stupid." *Einstein*

+ know what your goals and your priorities are
### Unsubscribe
+ from all the rubbish ... start own personal detox
+ get rid of all the toxic influences that are holding you back
+ connect with people & stories that inspire you and build you up
+ chose your social influencers

### In My Opinion
An opinion is a belief or judgement that FALLS SHORT of absolute conviction, certainty or positive knowledge; it is a conclusion that certain facts or ideas are PROBABLY true or likely to prove so.

+ many opinions are not based on facts or solid grounds
+ everybody's got them
+ we often listen and accept the opinions of others (without them having a solid base)
+ be careful who's opinions you let in
+ only believe what empowers you ... and forget about the rest

Place IN MY OPINION in front of everything someone says ... this connects it to you and you can check that belief for yourself. Take power on what you belief.
