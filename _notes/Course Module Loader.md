Your brilliant insights deserve better than digital graveyards

Remember the frustration of course materials scattered across PDFs, worksheets, handouts,...? 

What if your students could instantly access and integrate all your course materials into their personal knowledge system with just one click?

That's the idea behind the Course Module Loader - a tool where participants can work with content, not just consume it. Integrated in Obsidian, the power tool for note makers.

â†’ Download and unpack course modules with a single command 
â†’ Automatically organize materials in your preferred structure 
â†’ Stay up-to-date with the latest course insights
â†’ Save valuable time for actual learning

It is for course designers who want to provide insights in an easy-to-use way.

â€”â€”â€”
P.S.
