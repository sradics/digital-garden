## Highlights
The manager fed in the requirements and—boom!—the GSI spit out a list of “resources” deployed for the project “team.” — location: [122](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=122) ^ref-47605

---
People are not interchangeable units, and technical skills are only part of the equation when people need to work collaboratively. — location: [124](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=124) ^ref-32425

---
the likelihood that any group of people actually gels and becomes a team is low. — location: [128](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=128) ^ref-34113

---
and most don’t show the level of responsibility and engagement managers hope for. Fundamentally, two factors determine whether a group will forge itself into a team: Do these people want to work on this problem? Do these people want to work with each other? Neither a computer program nor a manager can answer these questions. Only the employees who will do the work can. — location: [129](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=129) ^ref-44182

---
Managers worry that some work won’t be chosen—failing to account for employees who will do less-than-thrilling work because they understand that it’s necessary for continued operations and place high value on that. — location: [135](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=135) ^ref-10863

Management selection for teams actually works against team responsibility by communicating that people aren’t capable of making responsible — location: [138](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=138) ^ref-34316

---
Team self-selection creates the conditions for team engagement and responsibility. — location: [140](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=140) ^ref-26703

---
People want to do a good job and contribute to their customers and companies Employees work best when they have choice They take more responsibility for their own decisions than those made by others Collaborative work depends on relationships When you treat people like adults, they act that way Managers need to paint the vision of what needs to be done, organize the work in a sensible way, identify constraints, and then let employees choose their own teams. — location: [147](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=147) ^ref-41238

Removing the managers from the equation and trusting in the employees involved created a fascinating story and incredible outcomes for everyone. — location: [160](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=160) ^ref-57762

Another term for a self-selected team is a self-designed team. — location: [168](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=168) ^ref-17786

---
At the time people weren’t organized into fixed teams; rather, the teams were assembled at the start of a project and disassembled when the project ended. Employees were not dedicated to a team or project; their time was split into percentages and their assignments were determined by their manager. — location: [203](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=203) ^ref-10256

---
so there was no big picture of what was happening. — location: [208](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=208) ^ref-62270

---
Our strategy was to pull people out of this complex matrix and move them into fixed, stable teams where we could ensure that one person would work on only one team, and one team would work on only one project at any time. — location: [210](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=210) ^ref-8199

Today’s Work Demands Stable Teams In software development, stable teams are higher performing and more productive. — location: [227](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=227) ^ref-47030

1 difference in throughput between software development teams that were 95% or more dedicated compared with teams that were 50% or less dedicated. — location: [228](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=228) ^ref-26626

indicated that stable agile teams result in up to 60% higher productivity. — location: [231](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=231) ^ref-27148

---
Stable teams are more productive. One reason for greater productivity in stable teams is that they don’t have to repeatedly go through the team-building stages of forming, storming, norming, — location: [231](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=231) ^ref-4734

---
Constantly changing and churning teams (as you often get when assembling and disassembling specific project teams) may never get out of the initial forming stage, and they could forever stay a group of individuals, no matter how talented. People working in small, stable teams are also happier. — location: [233](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=233) ^ref-40591

---
Some of the responses highlighted that people felt more productive while working fewer hours and that being allocated 100% to one team reduced stress. — location: [236](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=236) ^ref-49731

A tribe is a collection of squads that work in related areas and can be seen as a kind of incubator for the squad mini-startups. Tribes have a fair degree of freedom and autonomy and are sized around the concept of Dunbar’s number, which states that people cannot maintain a social relationship with more than 150 people. — location: [261](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=261) ^ref-61742

---
attributable to the design of the team, 30% to the way the team is launched, and 10% to leader coaching once the team is under way. — location: [275](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=275) ^ref-25939

This model breaks down when a company grows or goes through a period of significant change, such as during an agile adoption. — location: [290](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=290) ^ref-30681

---
but it becomes increasingly difficult to understand the intricacies of relationships among people as the number of relationships increases almost exponentially. In our experience the breaking point is around ten people. — location: [291](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=291) ^ref-12055

---
It’s what managers do, right? They tell their staff what to work on. But something felt fundamentally wrong about the way we were going about it. — location: [300](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=300) ^ref-3290

---
and workers were pretty much interchangeable. — location: [303](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=303) ^ref-6467

---
In the complex and collaborative workflows of organizations today, however, managerial selection makes much less sense, — location: [304](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=304) ^ref-40977

freedom over some or all of the four main aspects of work: when they do it, how they do it, who they do it with, and what they do. — location: [310](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=310) ^ref-47299

---
gains in truly self-managed work environments start at a minimum of 35% higher than in traditionally managed organizations. — location: [316](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=316) ^ref-32963

Recruits were trusted to form their own crews without any guidance from senior commanders. There were no rules and no restrictions, other than the number of airmen and skills needed to man an aircraft. — location: [326](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=326) ^ref-60077

what they think is important, with whomever they like, and using whichever approach (agile certainly wasn’t prescribed) they think will work best to get the job done. — location: [337](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=337) ^ref-65517

---
People naturally form small, cross-functional teams. Teams are between three and six people — location: [339](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=339) ^ref-42030

---
There is no one person per skill, and those T-shaped people who are good at collaborating are in high demand. — location: [340](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=340) ^ref-23647

---
Time and again organizations fall into the trap of optimizing resources rather than focusing on outcomes. People often believe that multitasking, having people work across several projects, and focusing on resource utilization are the keys to success, when in reality they’re not. — location: [341](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=341) ^ref-14067

---
And nobody believes they are more valuable as specialists across teams than as generalizing specialists within one team. — location: [345](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=345) ^ref-18996

---
People communicate face to face. There are barely any discussions about process or how to communicate. Team members just talk and coordinate and collaborate as needed. Things are much faster that way. — location: [346](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=346) ^ref-15831

---
A shared, clear goal makes everything so much easier. When people buy into the goal and know clearly the problem they’re solving and understand why it’s a problem, things become a lot easier for everyone. — location: [349](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=349) ^ref-4634

---
What if a fight breaks out as people argue over joining one squad? What if someone gets picked on and pushed around by others? What if one person ends up standing in the corner on his own like the last kid chosen for sports at school? What if people want to join a squad they are totally unskilled and inappropriate for? What if one particular squad or area is very popular? What if no one wants to work in a particular area? — location: [426](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=426) ^ref-42977

---
What if no one turns up, out of fear or because they don’t like the idea of self-selection? — location: [430](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=430) ^ref-22601

(If your self-selection involves fewer than thirty people, your life will be easier, and there’s no need to run a trial first. — location: [446](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=446) ^ref-6033

---
All of the employees in the newly selected squads were either in the team they wanted to be in or fully understood the reason why they had chosen differently. — location: [452](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=452) ^ref-22868

We needed to make everything bigger, bolder, and brighter so that it would be easy to interpret the status of a squad at a glance. — location: [464](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=464) ^ref-13018

Take the time to talk through their worries and ideas, but slowly encourage them to see the opportunities. — location: [516](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=516) ^ref-62344

---
It’s possible to give people a roadmap and product strategy to determine which squads are required, but for us this proved to be too complex. Not only did staff members not know where to start, but they also didn’t know how best to meet the needs of the organization. — location: [528](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=528) ^ref-40540

---
We wanted to make sure that our squads would have a purpose that went beyond the current project so that we could reap the performance gains that come with stable squads. — location: [532](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=532) ^ref-28412

---
It wasn’t easy to establish exactly how many squads we needed, and we knew that the number of people in a squad would vary (between three and seven), — location: [538](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=538) ^ref-52378

---
Having prioritized and planned for the squads, we next needed to paint a clear picture of their purpose so that participants could choose what they wanted to work on and the kind of problems they would solve. — location: [543](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=543) ^ref-1530

---
We prefer squads to have a clear mission rather than to be general purpose. In his 2002 book, Leading Teams: Setting the Stage for Great Performances [Hac02], J. Richard Hackman cites research showing — location: [549](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=549) ^ref-51728

---
The better the product owners can explain their squad, its mission, and how they themselves work, the better chance they have of attracting a great squad and, just as important, the right squad to match them and their working styles. — location: [556](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=556) ^ref-6060

---
We tried to avoid component squads because we strongly believed that having an end-to-end view and a customer-centric purpose would give us the best results. — location: [561](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=561) ^ref-19575

---
The names we initially chose for self-selection were preliminary names to reflect the purpose, but we had no issue with squads changing their names after they had kicked off. — location: [563](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=563) ^ref-35151

---
we opted for preselecting the product owner for each squad. — location: [570](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=570) ^ref-39691

---
Another reason we chose to preselect the product owners is that they’re the people who give the squads direction. — location: [572](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=572) ^ref-54773

---
If you do have preselected people, it’s important to reflect this openly, — location: [583](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=583) ^ref-4300

---
On the other hand, starting from the status quo—reflecting a current team structure as the starting point—makes the process real, and it helps those who want to stay exactly where they are to do so and not feel like they’re being bumped. — location: [587](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=587) ^ref-13903

---
You should define the following details as early as possible. When will your event take place? Where it will take place? Who will be there? — location: [591](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=591) ^ref-15318

---
Consider also having a backup date in case of last-minute problems or illness of key people. — location: [594](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=594) ^ref-11460

---
You’ll need a big, open collaborative area with lots of wall space to visualize the status of your squads and the progress of the self-selection process. — location: [602](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=602) ^ref-15688

---
We recommend that you allow as many employees to self-select as possible. If in doubt, include everyone who could be included in a squad. — location: [609](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=609) ^ref-4871

---
People often act differently when observers or their managers are present. — location: [612](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=612) ^ref-2064

---
fear of something new and different, fear of what might happen, fear of being stuck with someone they don’t get along with, or fear of being stuck in a squad that they can’t change their mind — location: [616](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=616) ^ref-53559

---
By engaging with our coworkers early we surfaced these questions before the event, and we were able to individually answer them and follow up. — location: [620](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=620) ^ref-36298

---
but regardless, we were also able to answer that we would be carefully facilitating the session, so no bullying would be allowed. For example, if no one wanted to join one of our squads, this would actually be incredibly useful information that would feed into any future prioritization and tell us that we were probably trying to establish a squad that shouldn’t be established. — location: [625](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=625) ^ref-9968

---
Talk to as many people as possible, right through the process. Actively listen to their concerns and — location: [628](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=628) ^ref-1581

---
acknowledge and record them. Be patient with participants as they work through their fears. Record any concerns and the what-if scenarios so that they can be addressed. Paint a very honest picture about the worst-case scenario, which is never as bad as people think. Talk to staff members individually and present to groups. Be clear about why you’re doing this and emphasize that you’re placing trust in employees to solve the problem. — location: [629](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=629) ^ref-11116

It felt like we were running a PR campaign. In fact, we probably were running a PR campaign: emails, all-company meetings, one-on-one meetings, and conversations at lunch and on the way to the bathroom (even in the bathroom!). We — location: [650](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=650) ^ref-36171

---
We think you do. We can provide the environment and the facilitation techniques but we’re asking you to solve the puzzle.” Ultimately, just saying to people “Look, we trust you to do this” seemed to be the tipping point. — location: [652](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=652) ^ref-23214

Keeping the rules short and simple makes the problem of establishing new squads and choosing the right people easier to solve. We believe that the more rules there are, the more complex the puzzle. — location: [662](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=662) ^ref-3265

Squads have to be capable of delivering end to end. Squads have to be made up of three to seven people. Squads have to be co-located. — location: [666](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=666) ^ref-51034

you could easily find out on the day that you don’t have the right ratio of talent in your organization.

only thing worse than management selection is a fake version of self-selection where people are led to believe they will self-select only to find out the decision wasn’t theirs at all, — location: [700](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=700) ^ref-59806

Welcome the participants and kick off the event. Allow the product owners to pitch for their squads. Facilitate several rounds of self-selection, usually three to four time frames of ten minutes, followed by a period to pause and reflect. Wrap up, close the event, and clarify what will happen next. — location: [722](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=722) ^ref-11214

---
We recommend collecting the most frequently asked questions and preparing a simple yet comprehensive FAQ sheet for the event. It’s a good way to make the details front of mind for participants. — location: [730](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=730) ^ref-22397

Do I have to stay where I am? This really is self-selection. You don’t have to stay where you are if you don’t want to—although it’s totally fine if you do! You choose! What squads can I choose from again? — location: [733](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019EKWG6M&location=733) ^ref-1382
