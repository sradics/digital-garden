## Highlights
* OKRs are the filters that sit on top of the backlog
* Will this work item help us achieve one of our key results? 2. If the answer is no, we remove the item completely from our product backlog. 3. If the answer is yes, we add it to our product backlog. 4. If the answer is maybe, we add it to our product backlog as a learning (product discovery) activity.
* Which of the items in our product backlog will help us move the fastest towards our key results? The answer here becomes your next sprint backlog.
