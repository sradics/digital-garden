How Connecting Two Dots Brought Me to Tears

â†’ Have you ever experienced epiphany moments?

Last week I joined a great live session with Eleen Yaw
Your Voice on LinkedIn - and it opened my eyes.

I found my next connection to creativity. 

For a long time I struggled with creativity.
â†’ It is a talent > One has it or bad luck.
â†’ I had given up. Left it "the gifted" 
â†’ I got stuck in standard ways

Then I learned one new key concept.

Creativity is about 
âž  CONNECTING things IN NEW WAYS

This was a relief for me:
I learned to connect my thoughts

â†’ I started with manual connections
â†’ It grow with using my Second Brain
â†’ And I'm now inviting AI for randomness 

And still something was missing. 
I even did not know that I miss it.
It was a so called unknown UNKNOWN 

Until Eleen's event. 
And I thank you so much for that new link.

âž  When we are Creative it the UNIQUE us showing

â†’ No one has all the same experiences
â†’ That leads to a creative expression
â†’ we show ourselves through it

To conclude:
âž  Creativity provides us a MEANING

When I realized that, I had tears in my eyes.

Through creative expression, you leave a footprint.

From Eleen's session, I got many new learnings.

â†’ I captured insights in my Second Brain
â†’ I'm reading a deep dive on it now
â†’ I'm expressing thoughts
â†’ And I setup AI for help 

âž  I made sure I can keep these insights forever

What is your ONE connection to creativity?
