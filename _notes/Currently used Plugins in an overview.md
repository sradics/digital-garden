# Currently used Plugins in an overview
You can find all installed plugins and detailed descriptions how to use them in your Settings - Community plugins. I'll shortly describe why I installed the following plugins.

## Advanced Tables
If you want to work with tables in Obsidian this simplifies that a lot.

## Dataview
Create queries based on Obsidian Notes and Tasks. This is e.g. used in [Home](Home.md) to list spaces and open tasks. 

## Excalidraw
Great plugin to draw directly inside Obsidian. Needs some learning how to use it properly, but once mastered it becomes a strong companion for working with visualisations and embedding that directly in your notes.

## Kanban
Create Kanban boards directly in Obsidian. I use that e.g. for the list of books I'm reading and tracking progress for processing books through by Second Brain funnel.

See this embedded reading list [_Reading Order](_Reading%20Order.md)

## Calendar
Displays the calendar tab on the right side. In the calendar daily notes from your journal will be automatically linked. And you can also easily create a daily note from the calendar. In addition the calendar is displayed on topic right in your daily note.

## Templater
Provides a set of useful functions to work with templates. E.g. if you create a note in [Fleeting notes](Midjourney%20V6%20prompts%20examples/030-039%20Areas/32%20Zettelkasten/Fleeting%20notes/Fleeting%20notes.md) the temlate [TPL Fleeting Note](TPL%20Fleeting%20Note.md) is automatically applied.

## Admonition
Provide a rich configuration to work with Callouts in your notes like that:

```ad-tip
collapse: open
Working with callouts provides a great way to better format important information.

```
