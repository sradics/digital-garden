I started 3AM in Berlin and arrived 3PM in LA.  
  
â†’ The adventure starts, and Jet Lag hints welcome  
  
Day 0: Arrival. Shortly checked in.  
  
Followed by a great first in person get together with [Billy Broas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billybroas/), [Isabella Masucci](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabella-masucci-79418080/) and like me, readers and practitioners of  
ðŸ“– Simple Marketing for Smart People.  
  
Great to hear how all enjoy Billy's Five Lightbulbs Marketing.  
  
At the same time, we are all unitedÂ through one main further topic.  
  
â†’ we meet in LA for the next two days  
â†’ at the [hashtag#secondbrainsummit](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=secondbrainsummit&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7247564368626823169)  
  
â‡¢ to get inspiration  
â‡¢ to understand current approaches  
â‡¢ to experience our connection with the topic
