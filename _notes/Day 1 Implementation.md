# Day 1 Implementation

S: pick a quote** **==that hits you hard==** 
R: I can write an Qdrant Collection with all my books and then search for quotes that might relate to my program. Just followed that hunch ...

The topic I pick: When we leverage the strength of AI, we can focus more on the strength of being human.

Input:
S:
AI speeds up  
- researching  
- differentiation  
- finding sources  
- assessment design  
- scope and sequence planning  
  
So I can slow down to  
- empathise  
- engage  
- wonder  
- ponder  
- reflect  
- pray

**_question it_**¬†_until you find a unique perspective._
By asking who, what, why, when, where,_¬†**_or_**¬†_how_
This step creates something unique to work with!

S: Create an assistant for that flow!

Why does the delegation to AI lead to more focus on our strength?

What might then be new focus areas, that are human centric?
- How are these areas backed with argumentation. 
- How long will this create a secure heaven?
- What are the AI strength areas?
	- What does that mean for delegtion?

What is the crucial argument to get people moving forward to learn to walk with AI?

Write a first draft with PAS - **problem, amplify, solution**

**Second Brain:****"Your mind will become more focused, knowing it can put thoughts on hold and access them later"**

"The brain actually prefers external sources, because they take no energy to maintain" - speaks for higher motivation we gain

vs. digital dementia to describe how overuse of digital technology results in the breakdown of cognitive abilities

### **The Optimal Approach Combines All Three:**

1. **Memorization Skills** for **core knowledge** that needs instant access
2. **Second Brain Systems** for **complex information** and **creative synthesis**
3. **Extended Mind Awareness** for **environmental design** and **tool selection**

From extend your mind:

"We self-engineer ourselves to think and perform better in the worlds we find ourselves, and we self-engineer worlds in which to build better worlds to think in"

"Augmentation is all about making something better by enhancing"

Great analogy:
"The calculator doesn't remove the need for us to understand math, but it allows us to do more complex calculations faster and more accurately"

Co-Intelligence:
"AI has the potential to automate mundane tasks, freeing us for work that requires uniquely human traits such as creativity and critical thinking"

"The ability to outsource crappy, meaningless tasks to the AI can be freeing" - here I can add my experience

Strong question:
How can AI facilitate my knowledge so I have more time to dedicate to the application of that knowledge?

‚ùå
"Neuroscientist Manfred Spitzer uses the term digital dementia to describe how overuse of digital technology results in the breakdown of cognitive abilities"

"When we use AI to generate our first drafts, we don't have to think as hard or as deeply about what we write" ... extending question, why should we think deep and how actually would that look like. When is it fruitful and when just a waste of time. 

S: Observation: How much should I try to extract from a book vs. when should I active my own deeper thinking

Outlive: 
"The more of these networks and subnetworks that we have built up over our lifetime, via education or experience, or by developing complex skills... the more resistant to cognitive decline we will tend to be" -- what speaks for still staying highly engaged with out brain usage. So - it is mandatory to start thinking about higher levels of using our brains. Whatever that actually means. 

Human strength: 
- The key to creativity is being able to switch between a wide-open, playful mind and a narrow analytical frame
- gut feeling is not a mysterious force, but an incorporated history of experience
- Intuition is the defining quality of a great chess player... Often, your gut will serve you better than your brains
- Humans are actually wired to connect... when we engage with another person, we are, in fact, embarking on an intimate brain-to-brain connection --- so more time for social interactions, more happiness
	- TODO: Find backing between more social connections leads to more happiness
	- The Empathetic Elephant: known for their exceptional emotional intelligence, deep understanding of others, and their ability to forge strong connections - search for more details on that.
- I need to unpack that one: The human capacity to sense dissonance in the present moment and see the potential for change strikes me as one of our most extraordinary gifts‚Äîour restless, never-satisfied, creative spirit

## Argumentation base

- When used for **augmentation rather than replacement**
- When humans maintain **active engagement** in learning and skill development
- When AI handles **routine tasks** while humans focus on **creative, strategic, and interpersonal work**

### **‚ùå WHEN AI UNDERMINES HUMAN STRENGTHS:**

- When it creates **cognitive dependence** without building underlying capabilities
- When it **shortcuts the learning process** essential for expertise development
- When it **replaces rather than enhances** human thinking

Great quote:
**The key insight:****"As alien as AIs are, they're also deeply human" [[@mollick_co-intelligence_2024]]

## My writing exercise

My claim: When we leverage the strength of AI, 
we can focus more on the strength of being human.

You don't develop deeper thinking because you don't free yourself from low value but time consuming activities. You read a book with high effort in reading but you rarely take action. You got to courses with weeks of time invested and thousand of euros paid but the outcomes are mediocre at best. 

The question is, why do we repeat this pattern of high effort, low outcome so often. 
Do we get tired on the path? Do we take the secure path of feel good learning and shy away from facing the truth of really understanding? 

With AI's capabilities we can reduce the friction of maintaining and transforming information. We are able to store with instant retrieval and at the same time we don't have to care about structure all too much. 

We already can create coaches, mentors, advisors with a quality level where I dare to say that this beats many of the human counterparts already. Yet, if I talk to peers about their usage of these capabilities its often a shrugging shoulder, no clue yet answer. 

Is that because we are just to busy to drill down into information leverage and with that better knowledge leverage. Is that because we just don't know where to start and thats why delay the initial step. Is that because we are afraid of the final consequences of facing the brutal reality? The reality that most of our previous busy work activities either are already obsolete and will vanish in the near future?

Since I adopted and AI First Mindset I feel a daily difference. With and AI First mindset I ask right from the start how current AI capabilities can support me in achieving the outcome I want to reach. My focus is on the outcome. And creating that outcome with minimal friction on the path. For example, when I studied information science and became a software developer, I was proud that I was able to create solutions by developing a software vehicle. Very often I knew what component I needed to reach that outcome. Back then, the friction was actually then writing the code. An effort to learn a programming language, and during my career I guess these were at least Assembler, Pascal, C, C++, Java, Python + 5 more. Then understanding specifics of each approach and turning that into software programs. I call that friction, because it takes time to learn that stuff, time to then write it down. Back then I always wished a neuronal plug that does the writing while reading my mind on the direction. 

Today, 24 years later, it feels like having this mind-to-coding connection. When I observe myself writing code, it is mainly instructing AI on the direction and then working with the immediate outcomes. Rarely with a real need to correct the outcomes. It became quite frictionless. With the consequence that I can now create an outcome in a matter of minutes what previously took me hours if not days. 

I face these options to remove friction all over the place. In my daily operations, now working with over 40 AI assistants and counting, this low level of friction becomes a real business enabler. I can play on so many fields of business as a solopreneur where I would have needed an team in the past. And I'm much faster, it is also fun and capabilities are increase. As human, as me I operate on a level higher than in the past. 

I meander into fields that where inaccessible due to time constraints and money constraints in the past. I have my English coach beside me 24/7. I can dumb a learning nugget to AI and retrieve option for better phrasing and reasoning in seconds. 

I'm also getting into writing more. A field that I was always scared of. Now even combined with writing in English. Even more scary. To support me on that journey I build writing analysts that study great authors. Theses assistants support me in various aspects with my own writing. Or in a wider context, with my own expression and with externalizing my thoughts. I discovered writing as the door opener to access my thoughts and to gain deeper clarity on what I want to say and to express. 

If I can't phrase it properly, then my thoughts are not yet clear. With the help of AI, I reached a level of expressing, that I never dared to access. I levelled up. Now I can share my thoughts, much better than a year ago and still with quite some journey ahead. It is challenging, sure. At the same time it is rewarding. And it is with far less friction. I can turn to my editor in seconds. I can back my claims with proofs by having access to my 400 books in seconds. I can do a deeper research in minutes. I can Zoom in/out, I can transform to different media. All that through having that basics in place. The basics of having access to my information and knowledge. The basic of being proficient in using AI. And now more and more of the basics to express. 

I got rid of the lower level activities, like re-reading, searching, manually transforming, manually researching. Instead I'm able to fully focus on what matters more to me. To express. To create outcomes through applying my knowledge. 

Do I become more human? What actually would it mean to become more human. 
What I dream of is to become free and much more independent. Free in that sense would mean to be able to follow my curiosity in more depth. Without a real stop watch. Without the tight money constraints. It is about engaging where I want to and about agency and own decision. It is about wondering and dreaming and following up on a path that shows. It is about exploring what shows up from gut feeling, from our subsconcious mind without tough time and budget constraints. It's about embedded natural breaks, when I need it. 

Sometime I hear the argument that me might stop using our brains, that we become stupid, that we will face digital dimentia. All that because we start to rely to heavily on AI. And for many this might be a real threat. Because they forgot about their real inner curiosity. Because they fed this curiosity with distractions. Or because they silenced their curiosity with limiting beliefs about growth potentials. 
I wish to remove these blinders. Like I removed them for myself. I wish to build a bridge for tapping into our curiosity again. For experiencing the pure joy of discovery, of finding a solution, for having an heureka moment. 

### Observations

- Long, and missing structure
- I got lost on the way - with zooming in/out
- I had to remind myself on the main topic
- Was it going deep, because someone expects that I go deep?

## Refined with better PAS structure

Note: I refined that with Claude. Asking for a better application of the PAS

---

You don't develop deeper thinking because you're trapped in low-value, time-consuming activities. You read books with high effort but rarely take action. You attend courses‚Äîweeks invested, thousands paid‚Äîbut outcomes remain mediocre at best.

Why do we repeat this pattern of high effort, low outcome so relentlessly?

Because we're exhausted before we even start. We choose the safe path of feel-good learning over the brutal truth of real understanding. We're too busy drowning in information management to focus on knowledge leverage. We delay starting because we don't know where to begin.

But here's the brutal reality: Most of our "busy work" activities are already obsolete. While AI capabilities can create coaches and mentors that surpass many human counterparts, when I ask peers about using these tools, I get shrugging shoulders and "no clue yet" responses.

We're standing at the edge of transformation, paralyzed by our own patterns.

Adopt an AI-First Mindset.

From the moment you encounter any task, ask: "How can current AI capabilities support me in achieving this outcome with minimal friction?"

This isn't about replacing your thinking‚Äîit's about freeing your thinking from the mundane so you can focus on what makes you uniquely human: creativity, intuition, and deep insight.

```
Thanks for this overview, quite okish. But now I think we lose the reader by placing far too many assumptions about their understanding. We don't meet the reader where they are at the moment. In my opinion, I did provide more details, actually with the aim to explain better (maybe not all of them, and maybe also with too much side tracking.) So let's bring in supporting examples and evidence, so we help the reader to make the important transitions
```

## Improved PAS version

You know that feeling when you finish reading a business book, close it with good intentions, but three months later can barely remember the key insights? Or when you complete an expensive course, feeling motivated during the sessions, but struggle to apply what you learned in your actual work?

You're not alone. Most of us are caught in what I call the "high effort, low outcome" trap. We invest significant time and money in learning, but the practical results don't match our investment.

Let me paint a picture of what this looks like in daily life:

You read a 300-page book on productivity. It takes you 8 hours. You highlight passages, maybe even take notes. But when you try to implement the system, you get overwhelmed by all the steps and abandon it within a week.

You attend a 2000‚Ç¨ leadership workshop. Two full days of insights and frameworks. You leave energized with a notebook full of ideas. But back at the office, urgent emails and meetings consume your attention. The notebook sits on your shelf, gathering dust.

You watch online courses during lunch breaks, accumulating certificates. Yet when faced with real challenges at work, you still rely on the same old approaches because you can't quickly access or apply what you learned.

Here's what's really happening: We're spending 80% of our energy on information consumption and only 20% on knowledge application. It's like buying expensive ingredients but never cooking the meal.

The brutal truth? While we're stuck in this exhausting cycle, AI capabilities have quietly evolved to solve exactly these problems. AI can now serve as a personal research assistant, a writing coach, even a thinking partner. But when I mention this to colleagues, I typically get responses like "I tried ChatGPT once, but didn't know what to ask" or "Isn't that cheating?"

We're standing next to a powerful tool that could transform our learning, but we're afraid to pick it up.

Here's what changed everything for me: Instead of learning first and then trying to apply, I started with a simple question for every task: "How can AI help me achieve this outcome faster and better?"

Let me show you what this looks like in practice:

**Example 1 - Reading a Business Book:**
- Old way: Read entire book, take notes, try to remember key points
- AI-enhanced way: Upload book highlights to AI, ask for key frameworks, request specific applications to my industry, get personalized action steps
- Result: 3 hours instead of 8, with immediately actionable insights

**Example 2 - Learning a New Skill:**
- Old way: Watch course videos, take notes, practice alone, struggle with questions
- AI-enhanced way: Use AI as practice partner, get instant feedback, ask clarifying questions anytime, receive personalized exercises
- Result: Faster skill acquisition with continuous support

**Example 3 - Applying Knowledge at Work:**
- Old way: Try to remember what I learned, search through notes, often give up and use familiar approaches
- AI-enhanced way: AI assistant trained on my learning materials, instant access to relevant frameworks for current challenges
- Result: Consistent application of new knowledge in real situations

I'm not suggesting you stop learning or thinking. I'm suggesting you stop doing the tedious parts that prevent you from focusing on the valuable parts.

Think of it like this: A carpenter doesn't make their own nails - they focus on crafting beautiful furniture. Similarly, you don't need to manually organize, search, and retrieve information - you can focus on creating insights and solutions.

When I say "AI-First Mindset," I mean asking that simple question before starting any learning or thinking task. Not to replace your brain, but to amplify it.

You're still doing the creative thinking, the decision-making, the insight generation. You're just not wasting time on the mechanical parts that drain your energy and enthusiasm.

Pick one learning challenge you're facing right now. Before diving in the traditional way, pause and ask: "How could AI help me approach this differently?"

The tools are ready.  So why not start small. Start curious. Start today?

```
That is already stronger. Yet I miss the even higher level outcome. To free ourselfes. To reach higher levels as human. The current version is quite operative level. I like that to, as this makes it also actionable. But I also want to create a vision, I want to touch on an emotion.
```

## Iteration 3 - VISION-ENHANCED PAS VERSION

I also added an iteration with [[Day 01 - Instructions#5) Question & Object]]

You're learning wrong. And it's killing your dreams

Last month you read a business book. This week you can't remember what it said? 
Or when you complete an expensive course, feeling motivated during the sessions, but struggle to apply what you learned in your actual work?

But here's what really hurts: It's not just about wasted time or money. It's about the dreams you're not pursuing because you're exhausted by the mechanics of learning itself.

You're not alone. Most of us are caught in what I call the "high effort, low outcome" trap. We invest significant time and money in learning, but the practical results don't match our investment. More importantly, we never get to the good stuff - the creative exploration, the deep thinking, the breakthrough moments that make us feel truly alive.

Let me paint a picture of what this looks like in daily life:

You read a 300-page book on productivity. It takes you 8 hours. You highlight passages, maybe even take notes. But when you try to implement the system, you get overwhelmed by all the steps and abandon it within a week. Meanwhile, the innovative project you've been dreaming about remains just that - a dream. Because you're too drained from fighting with information to create something meaningful.

You attend a 2000‚Ç¨ leadership workshop. Two full days of insights and frameworks. You leave energized with a notebook full of ideas. But back at the office, urgent emails and meetings consume your attention. The notebook sits on your shelf, gathering dust. And that vision you had for transforming your team? It fades as you get pulled back into reactive mode.

You watch online courses during lunch breaks, accumulating certificates. Yet when faced with real challenges at work, you still rely on the same old approaches because you can't quickly access or apply what you learned. Your curiosity - that spark that once drove you to explore new ideas - slowly dims under the weight of information overload.

Here's what's really happening: We're spending 80% of our energy on information consumption and only 20% on knowledge application. But more tragically, we're spending 0% on what makes us uniquely human - wondering, creating, connecting dots in ways only we can.

It's like being a brilliant composer who spends all day tuning instruments instead of writing music.

The brutal truth? While we're stuck in this exhausting cycle, AI capabilities have quietly evolved to solve exactly these problems. AI can now serve as a personal research assistant, a writing coach, even a thinking partner. But when I mention this to colleagues, I typically get responses like "I tried ChatGPT once, but didn't know what to ask" or "Isn't that cheating?"

We're standing next to a powerful tool that could liberate our minds, but we're afraid to pick it up.

Here's what changed everything for me: Instead of learning first and then trying to apply, I started with a simple question for every task: "How can AI help me achieve this outcome faster and better?"

But this isn't just about efficiency. This is about reclaiming your mental freedom.

Let me show you what this looks like in practice:

**Example 1 - Reading a Business Book:**
- Old way: Read entire book, take notes, try to remember key points
- AI-enhanced way: Upload book highlights to AI, ask for key frameworks, request specific applications to my industry, get personalized action steps
- Result: 3 hours instead of 8, with immediately actionable insights
- **The real win**: 5 extra hours to explore that crazy idea you've been putting off

**Example 2 - Learning a New Skill:**
- Old way: Watch course videos, take notes, practice alone, struggle with questions
- AI-enhanced way: Use AI as practice partner, get instant feedback, ask clarifying questions anytime, receive personalized exercises
- Result: Faster skill acquisition with continuous support
- **The real win**: Confidence to tackle challenges you previously thought were beyond your reach

**Example 3 - Applying Knowledge at Work:**
- Old way: Try to remember what I learned, search through notes, often give up and use familiar approaches
- AI-enhanced way: AI assistant trained on my learning materials, instant access to relevant frameworks for current challenges
- Result: Consistent application of new knowledge in real situations
- **The real win**: You become the person who brings fresh perspectives and innovative solutions

When you free yourself from the mechanical parts of learning, something magical happens. You start operating at a higher level as a human being.

You follow your curiosity without the stopwatch of tedious research. You explore ideas that seemed too time-intensive before. You write that article, start that project, have those deep conversations that energize you.

I'm not just talking about productivity gains. I'm talking about reclaiming your time to think about what matters. About becoming the person who wonders "What if..." and actually has the capacity to find out.

Think of it like this: A carpenter doesn't make their own nails - they focus on crafting beautiful furniture. Similarly, you don't need to manually organize, search, and retrieve information - you can focus on creating insights, making connections, and bringing your unique perspective to the world.

When I say "AI-First Mindset," I mean asking that simple question before starting any learning or thinking task. Not to replace your brain, but to liberate it.

You're still doing the creative thinking, the decision-making, the insight generation. You're just not wasting your precious mental energy on tasks that drain your enthusiasm for learning itself.

This is about becoming more human, not less. More curious, more creative, more connected to what truly matters to you.

Pick one learning challenge you're facing right now. Before diving in the traditional way, pause and ask: "How could AI help me approach this differently?"

But also ask: "What would I explore if I had 5 extra hours this week? What idea have I been putting off because I didn't have the mental bandwidth?"

Start small. Start curious. Start today.

The tools are ready. Your curiosity deserves to be unleashed.
Your dreams deserve more than the scraps of energy left after fighting with information.

You can continue spending your precious mental energy on the mechanics of learning, leaving yourself too exhausted for the magic of discovery.

Or you can let AI handle the boring stuff so you can do the creative stuff - and finally become the person you've always had the potential to be.

Try this tomorrow: Before starting any learning task, ask 'How can AI help?' Then tell me what happened.

```
You have the mind of the average social media user scrolling through content. [I write in a blunt, direct style that cuts through the noise. My readers expect bold statements and provocative takes, not gentle suggestions.]

Critique my writing with this in mind:
 
- Does this grab attention and make someone stop scrolling? (Questions as hooks are weak - focus on bold statements, provocative claims, or pattern interrupts)
- Am I being direct enough, or am I hedging and softening my message?
- Would this get shared because it's memorable and shareable?
- Does my conclusion hit hard or does it fizzle out?    
- What would trolls and skeptics say to try to tear this apart?
```

## Iteration 4 - VISION-ENHANCED PAS VERSION

You're learning wrong. And it's killing your dreams

Every book you read. Every course you take. Every certificate you collect. 
You feel smarter but you're not getting results.

That expensive course you took last month? You can't apply what you learned. That business book you highlighted? The insights are already forgotten. That's not learning failure - that's learning addiction.

You're trapped in the learning lie. High effort, zero results.

The brutal truth: You're spending 80% of your energy consuming information and 20% applying it. But here's what really hurts - you're spending 0% on what makes you uniquely human: wondering, creating, connecting dots in ways only you can.

You read a 300-page productivity book in 8 hours. You highlight, take notes, feel accomplished. Then you try to implement the system, get overwhelmed, and abandon it within a week. Meanwhile, that innovative project you've been dreaming about? Still a dream. Because you're too drained fighting with information to create anything meaningful.

You attend a 2000‚Ç¨ leadership workshop. Two days of frameworks and insights. You leave energized with a notebook full of ideas. Back at the office, emails and meetings consume you. The notebook collects dust. Your vision for transforming your team? Gone. 
You're back in reactive mode.

You watch online courses during lunch breaks, accumulating certificates. Yet when faced with real challenges at work, you still rely on the same old approaches because you can't quickly access or apply what you learned. Your curiosity - that spark that once drove you to explore new ideas - slowly dims under the weight of information overload.

Your notes are digital hoarding. Your certificates are participation trophies. 
Your learning habits are from 1995.

It's like being a brilliant composer who spends all day tuning instruments instead of writing music.

While you're stuck in this exhausting cycle, AI has quietly evolved to solve exactly these problems. AI can serve as your research assistant, writing coach, thinking partner. But mention this to colleagues and you get "I tried ChatGPT once" or "Isn't that cheating?"

AI doesn't make you lazy. Refusing to use AI makes you irrelevant.

Here's what changed everything for me: I stopped learning first and applying second. Instead, I ask one question for every task: "How can AI help me achieve this outcome faster?"

This isn't about efficiency. This is about mental liberation.

**Reading a Business Book:**
- Old way: 8 hours reading, highlighting, trying to remember
- AI way: Upload highlights, get frameworks, receive personalized action steps
- Result: 3 hours instead of 8, with actionable insights
- **Real win**: 5 hours to explore that crazy idea you've been avoiding

**Learning a New Skill:**

- Old way: Solo practice, struggle with questions, slow progress
- AI way: AI practice partner, instant feedback, personalized exercises
- Result: Faster acquisition with continuous support
- **Real win**: Confidence to tackle challenges you thought were impossible

**Applying Knowledge:**

- Old way: Search through notes, give up, use old approaches
- AI way: AI assistant trained on your materials, instant framework access
- Result: Consistent application in real situations
- **Real win**: You become the person bringing fresh perspectives

When you free yourself from learning mechanics, something magical happens. You operate at a higher level as a human being.

You follow curiosity without research stopwatches. You explore ideas that seemed too time-intensive. You write that article, start that project, have conversations that energize you.

I'm not just talking about productivity gains. I'm talking about reclaiming your time to think about what matters. About becoming the person who wonders "What if..." and actually has the capacity to find out.

Smart people use AI. Stubborn people stay busy.

A carpenter doesn't make nails - they craft furniture. You don't need to manually organize and retrieve information - you create insights, make connections, bring your unique perspective to the world.

This is about becoming more human, not less. More curious, more creative, more connected to what matters.

The future belongs to AI-amplified humans.

Pick one learning challenge you're facing right now. Ask: "How could AI approach this differently?" Then ask: "What would I explore with 5 extra hours this week?"

Start small. Start curious. Start today.

The tools are ready. Your curiosity deserves to be unleashed.
Your dreams deserve more than the scraps of energy left after fighting with information.

The choice is simple: Evolve or become irrelevant.

AI won't replace you. Someone using AI will.

You received feedback that AI-generated content often stands out because the language can feel too clinical, too perfect, and heavily influenced by marketing content. The suggestion was to tailor your content depending on the platform: punchy, short sentences work well for LinkedIn, but a more personal, narrative style might be better for a newsletter. It was also recommended that you try recording your own thoughts and then transcribing them to keep the text authentic and natural. Overall, the content was seen as valuable, but the form could be improved to make it more relatable and engaging.
