# Day 2 - Session notes
On 19th/20th September I joined the [Circle Community Summit](https://circle.so/bundle/). The following are key highlights from day two.

## Session with Ali Abdaal
+ **feel good productivity**
+ get started ... you don't need to know everything upfront
+ you can ==**just be a guide, a fellow traveller==** sharing the journey 
+ share from the heart
+ this prevents imposter syndrome --- this is big!
+ still respect time and have **providing value** in mind
+ don't rely on AdSense and Brand deals ... but start selling your own product
+ think about the monetization early on
+ "views don't pay the bills"
+ 3 highly recommended books
	+ üìñ [[Copywriting Secrets How Everyone Can Use the Power of Words to Get More Clicks Sales and ProfitsNo Matter What You Sell Or Who You Se - Jim Edwards]]
	+ üìñ [[100M Offers - Alex Hormozi]]
	+ üìñ [[Dotcom Secrets - Russell Brunson]]

### His funnel
![[Pasted image 20230920182406.png]]

+ **lead with value**, tangible suggestion
+ $1  with an order bump $27
+ stages: free - cheap - mid-ticket - high ticket
	+ **offering a product for every price point**
+ people are buying the offer --- and the fulfillment of the offer is a different thing??
	+ spent most of the time on the offer ... and this then drives the fulfillment
+ DOD
	+ facts, feelings, functionality
+ Problem analysis control
+ ask your audience ... 5 is already good
### Why do people join a community
+ to **address emotional problems** ... like imposter
+ **struggle with discipline, accountability, motivation**
+ community helps people to **get over their fears**

 **==people get a lot of value out of accountability==** - group or individual ... setting themself goals

## Session Scale like a Pro with Nicole Walters
+ WHERE TO START - with your best business idea and why everything the 'experts' are teaching isn't working for YOU.
+ AVOID WASTING TIME AND MONEY - on marketing tricks that don't work or convert.
+ STAY STEADY - in a shaky economy.
+ BUILD MULTIPLE INCOME STREAMS - while providing real value to your customers and stop the feast or famine cycle that everyone is teaching online.
+ provide many products and ways for people to engage with us
+ ensure multiple income streams
	+ lots of different and related income streams
+ you need to **mention: What are people missing**

### The most important things you need 
+ **Legal**
	+ contract, obligations, protecting the product
+ **Financials**
	+ P&L
+ **Taxes**
+ **Product Development**
	+ set up consultation!!
	+ set up a time book tool ... calendly, superpeer.com, topmate.io
	+ R&D - testing - marketing - launch
+ **stop doing things for free** ... be clear where they are going to afterwards
+ loss leader --- to open the door (e.g. freemium)
+ **put a price on your time**

Provide and collect eMails. Grow your eMail list. Consistency and value delivery grows your list.

**==She did not spent a dollar in adds.==**

**Facebook build Facebook without Facebook**

## Guide your first 25 members John Moore, Sean Cannell
+ level up as you go
+ **big things take time to build**
+ **==build a framework!==**
	+ your unique way of doing it
+ give everything away for free ... there will always be people who will pay you for the higher support
+ be **obsessed with Customer Feedback** and kill your darlings
+ avoid to over-teach and consider the course of knowledge
	+ "everybody already knows this..."
	+ **simplicity, clarity and create quick wins!**
	+ **Slow it down and make it super simple**
	+ **Short videos, shorter trainings**
	+ where do you want to get them
	+ get them to feel transformation ... your mission is the transformation
