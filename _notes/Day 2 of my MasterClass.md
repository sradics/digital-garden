Learning is a journey we all embark on.

Yet, most never know where to start.

What was ONE magic moment in your learning journey?

That question opened Day 2 of my 2-day virtual masterclass
where I help you LEARN HOW TO LEARN, retain and recall with ease.

Attendees shared inspiring insights.
I felt the energy. 
I love these moments where groups unite.

As this energized a group

â†’ We explored our Learning Types

â†’ Walked through a full Learning cycle

â†’ Got an idea of working with a Second Brain

On top, we discussed benefits of AI 

â‡¢ when personalized through our knowledge

At the same time, they were "just" impulses.
For topics to explore further to level up your learning. 

You can't achieve mastery in 2 hours.
I guess that is obvious.

But you can start the journey. 
And it starts with an impulse.

This impulse was sent yesterday. 
Now it can unfold its magic.

What was ONE magic moment in your learning journey?
