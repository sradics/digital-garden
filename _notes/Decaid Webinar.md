AI knowledge gap  
  
â†’ 68% of companies stuck  
  
I attended the Decaid Webinar yesterday -  
4 hours packed with actionable insights about:  
  
â†’ AI adoption journeys across different company stages  
â†’ The 3 phases of adoption: Fundament, Exploration, Scaling  
â†’ Differences between AI assistants, workflows, and agents  
â†’ Practical AI compliance  
  
The fully automated workflow from research to content using MAKE was impressive.  
  
Decaid delivered high value through clear explanations and inspiring examples.

I've shared detailed notes in my Digital Garden (link in comments).  
  
That 68% of companies cite missing AI-knowledge as their main adoption hurdle wasn't surprising. It confirms the urgent need for strategic upskilling.  
  
Many organizations remain in early stages with their learning programs despite AI being potentially the most disruptive technology we've faced.  
  
No time to wait.  
  
My recommendation:  
Take your next step today.  
Don't wait for others to lead the way.
