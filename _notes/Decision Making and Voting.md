# Decision Making and Voting
According to [[Kurt Cagle-Agile 2]] - Voting is not recommended for important issues. ==A vote indicates popularity== of an idea, rather than determining whether the idea is best.

I suggest to think about dimensions that enable a comparison of ideas. For example using the [[ICE prioritization]] combined with the [[Confidence Meter]]
