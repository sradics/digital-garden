## Informed Purposeful practice, Deliberate practice

Developing skills that others have figured out, i.e. **relying on an established knowledge base** about what training techniques and methods work

**Practicing with well-defined, specific goals** in mind

**Consistently** moving **outside your comfort zone**

Using **full attention and conscious actions**,. Involves being **fully present and engaged** in your training

**Using feedback and modification** to reach your goals

Developing effective mental representations, i.e. d**eveloping new cognitive frameworks that allow you to master the skillset**. It has been found in study after study of **expert performers** that they **have developed advanced mental representations** that allow them **to overcome limitations faced by other performers**.

Building upon your preexisting skillset, i.e. **building newly acquired skills on top of previously acquired skills**. This is the way that most learning is done and highlights the **importance of mastering ‘foundational’ skills**
