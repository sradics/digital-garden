Descript: My AI-First Video Editor for Course Recordings  
  
â†’ The AI video tool that turned my rambling Zooms  
  
For my Learning Ecosystem Mastery course, I've been using Descript and I'm impressed by both its powerful features and simplicity.  
  
My workflow:  
â†’ Set Zoom to record separate files for screen sharing and participants  
â†’ Import all files to Descript  
â†’ Use AI to remove filler words and long pauses  
â†’ Add explanatory overlays  
â†’ Publish to Descript's ad-free video library  
  
It's fun, efficient, and helps me build my video content library with ease.  
  
What video editing tool do you prefer?
