The desire-driven career:

â†’ I dared to disrupt my understanding

Madhesh Senthilvel wrote this morning 
"When you desire change, you disrupt understanding"

The quote resonated with me, 
but I didn't immediately understand it.

I analyzed its parts and reflected on them.
Then I reconstructed its meaning. 
(no ChatGPT, just me thinking here)

The part: "Desire change"
â€”â€”â€”
â†’  Desire means I'm looking for it, I crave it, I want it. 
â†’ (and I don't reject it) 

If you have a growth mindset. 
You see change as an opportunity 
to grow and reach a new stage. 

"Disrupt" means 
â€”â€”â€”
Change and adjust, but in a more 
drastic, serious, and perhaps abrupt manner.

At the same time not yet reaching a new stage. 
â†’ It is an intermediate state. 
â†’ That gets me moving. 
â†’ To then reach a new stage. 

"Understanding" means 
â€”â€”â€”
â†’ How I interpret the world. 
â†’ What I currently perceive as my perspective. 
â†’ What I can retrieve as knowledge on a topic. 

So "When you desire change, you disrupt understanding",
I can also express as:
â€”â€”â€”
When I work with a growth mindset to reach a new stage 
I can seriously challenge and 
likely adjust my perspective on 
what I know about a topic.

â†’ It is about looking for different perspectives.
â†’ It is about challenging our current set of beliefs.
â†’ It is about LEARNING BY SEEKING CHANGES

This reminds me of changes in my career. 
Where I felt a desire:
â†’ to grow, 
â†’ to move forward, 
â†’ to leave my status quo 

This was when I:
â€”â€”â€”
â†’ switched from developer to ScrumMaster
â†’ from German language only to an EN-speaking company
â†’ from ScrumMaster to Agile Coach
â†’  from Agile Coach to Lead and Manager

â†’ on to leading teams for Agile Coaches
â†’ on to Agile Coach on Company Level 
and discovering Product Coaching
â†’ on to Course Designer and Knowledge expert
â†’ on to Second Brainer 
â†’ on to Creator and Solopreneur

Did all these changes disrupt my understanding?

Absolutely, I can tell you.

But it was me, desiring that change. 

So: When you desire change, you disrupt understanding!

What was ONE change where you were in the driver's seat? 
Did that challenge your understanding too?

I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease
