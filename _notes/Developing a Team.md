## Principles of Sustainable Innovation
+ ask Why + 5 times
+ growing ideas
+ piloting ideas
+ TEAM US
+ actionism
+ sell your ideas

Foster divergent thinking - Convergent thinking is based in logic and practicality, while divergent thinking is based in creativity and flexibility

+ Creativity comes in waves and is different for every person
+ ride that waves when it comes
+ practice: take it to the extremes (serve just 1; serve 100000)
+ practice: force connections - what is true about ...my topic... that is also true to this ..reference object...
	+ and reverse -- what is not true about object a but is true for my topic
+ use all out sense - 22 senses!!
	+ time, smell,...
+ choose what to leave out


Brainstorming techniques
+ Flowers vs. Wheat ... take time to grow ideas a little longer to know what the flower actually is
+ SUN vs RAIN
	+ Sun stands for suspend (2 minutes timeout), understand, and nurture (and ..). Rain stands for react, assume, and insist
+ work with an outside facilitator
+ respect is a right
+ vote with your feed
+ voices are like spices
+ take a break - to allow own creative waves
	+ review all ideas a week later
+ consolidate the ideas
+ explore on 3-5 ideas - build-break-build again
+ now - fall in love with the idea
+ get momentum - create the smallest win .. that leads to bigger wins
	+ give ideas a try
	+ pivot and iterate quickly

### About innovation
+ Flex
	+ bend the rules
+ Fuse 
	+ combine to ideas into a new one
+ Fracture
	+ break a concept to several smaller ideas
