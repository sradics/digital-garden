# Developing a Zettelkasten
[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Br2gBA-1rM)
based on Obsidian

Invest in my note by adding own thoughts, connections, drawing conclusions.

Nice evolution path for notes in analogy to a digital garden.

Good structure how notes progress

## Cosmic soup
+ Initial questions, thought and source

## Stardust
+ good title
+ footer with references and tags
+ initial thought more verbalized

## Star
not perfect yet, but good
+ Describes thought already quite well, but still something missing
+ at least two links with other notes
+ embedded on an overview note (e.g. on a MOC)

## Bright Star
+ finished thought  (not depending on number of words)
+ no comments left
+ many links to other topics/areas

# Observations
+ Does Video directly with Obsidian notes
+ when working with tags outside frontmatter I can also use pictures for the text
+ CMT+CTRL+Leertaste shows Emojii

%%
Seems to be a comment function in Obsidian
