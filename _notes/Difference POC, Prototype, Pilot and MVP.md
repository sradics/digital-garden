A Proof of Concept (POC) validates the feasibility of a concept.  
  
A Prototype is a more advanced model showcasing the product's appearance and some functionality.  
  
A Pilot is a limited deployment of the product to a specific audience or in a specific region for testing purposes.  
  
A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the most basic version of the product with enough features to meet early adopters' needs and gather feedback for further development.  
  
  
The differences between these methods are illustrated in the diagram  
  
‚ÄûThey are used at different stages in the development process  
They need more or less resources.  
They vary in fidelity, level of detail or completion  
They may have different scope (i.e. testing parts of or the whole)‚Äú  
  
The horizontal axis indicates how ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù it is, ranging from idea to implemented solution. And the vertical axis indicates the ‚Äúunit of testing‚Äù, whether that be parts (elements of the solution) or the whole.
