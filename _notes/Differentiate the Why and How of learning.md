# [[Differentiate the Why and How of learning]]

## LinkedIn Post

[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_your-how-can-be-a-distraction-from-your-activity-7251472098903093248-t0WN?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

Your "How" can be a distraction from your "Why"

→ Sometimes, the learning itself is the distraction 

I need to remind myself about the "Why" of Learning.

I learned a lot about How to learn!

→ The Second Brain approach supports me in processing information from Capture to Expression. 

→ The 4MAT Learning Cycle helps you view learning holistically

→ Being aware of my the Learning Types and knowing my preferred one helps me to tailor my learning

→ Addressing your Beliefs about Learning helps with joy and focus

→ Investing in mental and physical fitness supports your brain 

Combining all five pillars leads to efficient learning. 

However, all five can still lead to learning in the wrong direction. 

I sometimes sense this for myself: 
→ There is an appetite for certain topics. 
→ I can go deep, nearly losing myself. 

This happens with topics like:

→ Working with data
→ Developing code
→ Strategy
→ Agile

But, these topics may not contribute best to my bigger goal:

My focus is to develop my business: 
I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease.

I defined my "WHY" of my learning. 

It currently involves:

→ Understanding the concrete problem space.
→ Finding the best solution that supports you to learn with impact.
→ With a path to earning money implemented. 

Rather than letting your “How” distract from your “Why"

Let your “Why” guide the path and 
implement it with the best “How.”

What is your "Why" and what is ONE next learning to get there?
