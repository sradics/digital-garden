# Dimensions to manifest learning - example learning to facilitate
Source: [Breakthrough facilitation](https://breakthrough-facilitation.com/)

## Train - to learn via guidance
1/ ==I trained==. I took my first facilitation training 15 years ago. This gave me the building blocks for The Breakthrough Facilitation Model â€• a framework that has sped up my design process and one I use to spark transformation in every session I lead.

## Observe - to understand how others are doing it
2/ ==I observed seasoned facilitators== in action. By experiencing what exceptional facilitation looks and feels like, I knew what standard I was trying to replicate in my practice.

## Practice - to apply 
3/ ==I practiced. A lot.== I put in thousands of hours taking the concepts I learned in my training and implementing them in my in-person and virtual sessions.

## Get Coaching - to get specific feedback
4/ ==I hired a facilitation coach==. My coach gave me ==specific feedback== on the specific areas I needed to improve. Areas I didnâ€™t even know I was struggling with. This is something I wish I would have done earlier.

## Read - to drill down on why
5/ ==I read books==. This helped me ==understand the why behind certain concepts== like psychological safety, and gave me a holistic understanding of exceptional facilitation. As a result, I ==donâ€™t just blindly replicate== other peopleâ€™s techniques. Instead, everything I do in my sessions is done with intention and has a specific purpose.

## Listen - to drill down on why
6/ ==I listened to podcast==s. This gave me even ==more concepts to learn== and helped me understand how I could vary my voice, cadence, and tone in order to sound more confident.

## Express - by building your own toolkit (or model)
7/ I ==poured through facilitation toolkits and built my own==. Whenever Iâ€™m feeling stuck or want to shake up the delivery of my content, I simply reach into my toolkit and pull out a fresh activity or tool to help me skyrocket participation.
