# Discovery of Core Values

> [!info] Core Values
> Who am I as a person. The principles that are not negotiable in your life.

 Big 3 areas
+ **Occasion**
+ **Life partner**
+ **community** to life in

(might be connected with [[The Big Five for Life]])

==People need a meaning to derive motivation==. Searching for meaning is a great motivation by itself.

> [!important]
> How we act and make choices determines our meaning.

Manage fears by pursuing them. 
+ Paradoxical intervention e.g. Try to blush when in front of others (when you fear blushing)

> [!tip] Search for violations
> To find core values - connect to situations when core values were violated.

Principles to consider:
+ be prepared
+ ==showing up honest, transparent, vulnerable creates trust==
+ schedule based on priority
+ ==ability to manage time==

### Priorities

Consider the ==4 domains Family, Business, Community, Self==
+ set 3 highest priorities in each
+ define key activities for each priority and use calendar blocking

What part of my life would I write with RED PEN (so can't be overwritten)

### Time management

+ proactive scheduling combined with calendar blocking
+ ensure meetings with purpose, outcome and clear timebox

## Strengthfinder

User the Strengthfinder to derive key strengths.

## Qualities of core values

+ ==connect to who you are in your core==
+ ==reflect YOUR differentiated point of view== - describe you well
+ best ==phrased as short & action oriented==
	+ e.g. "find a better way and share it"
+ enable to objectively rate yourself

One can use the opposite of bad phrasing to check if it is a core value.

## 4 Questions to discover your core values

+ ==In what work environments are you highly engaged?==
+ ==In what professional role or jobs did you do your best work?==
+ ==What help, advice or qualities do others come to you for?==
+ ==What do you want said about you in your enology (Lobrede)?==

Write down the answers and look for common themes/phrases.

## Authentic leadership

> [!important] True North
> Understand who you really are. What issues are the most important ones to focus on.

==Be true to yourself and your own beliefs.==
Take inspiration from your own stories ([[Storyworthy - Matthew Dicks]]). 

> [!question]
> What are my personal (important) stories that shaped my to become the person I am now?

### Great Leadership

> [!success] Motivate others
> Motivate, inspire others to reach their full potential. 

Are self aware:
+ what are you best at and what are core strengths
+ and complement shortcomings (with support from others)

==Act with integrity and follow their True North.==

==What motivates you extrinsically and intrinsically?==
+ Intrinsically - derived from your own sense of meaning
	+ e.g. personal growth, being true to believes
+ Balance both

Invest in relationships and build great supporting teams (networks).
[[Your Network Is Your Net Worth]]
