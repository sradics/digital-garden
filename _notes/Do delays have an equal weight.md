Confession: I put off a 5-minute task for months
Are we trapped in this 'small task, big procrastination' paradox?"

This morning, I observed myself finally tackling a task I had repeatedly postponed. 

â†’ First it was postponed because I was busy with preparing my workshops
â†’ Then, because of relocation planning
â†’ Finally, because of the actual move

You know what? 
These were all weak excuses.

This task took me just 5 minutes to complete. 
This task also was important. 
Yet, I still postponed it.

During this delay:

â†’ I repeatedly thought about the task
â†’ I had to respond to people waiting for its completion

What a waste.

This morning, I finally did it: 
found the document, scanned it, and sent it.

It felt surprisingly good, comparable to completing a much larger task.

Strange, isn't it!

Can we truly differentiate between big and small tasks regarding 
procrastination and associated negative feelings?

If not, would completing these small but important delayed tasks make us 
happier and more satisfied?

What do you think? 

What is ONE approach that helps you to tackle these small things, that in the past you would have postponed?
