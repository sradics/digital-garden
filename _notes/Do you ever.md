# [[Do you ever]]
## LinkedIn Post
[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_my-knowledge-was-leaking-heres-how-i-plug-activity-7315976884696084480-3H1s?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAA1M1pkBgWCYPhT45EpfLiHzViQqRWNCIv4)

My knowledge was leaking. Here's how I plug the holes.

Do you ever...

â†’ Spend 30+ minutes searching for a note, but can't remember where you saved it?

â†’ Feel that despite all the books and courses you invest in, you're not really retaining or applying what you learn?

â†’ Prepare for important meetings by recreating work you've done before, because finding the original would take too long?

These aren't minor inconveniences. 
These are symptoms of a broken approach to managing your most valuable asset: your knowledge.

Imagine instead:
â†’ Finding exactly what you need in seconds, not hours
â†’ Having your entire knowledge history at your fingertips 
â†’ Creating high-quality content in a fraction of the time 

And as a cherry on top: 
âž  Using AI as a thought partner who really knows what you know

This transformation is what we build in my 9-week program "Learning Ecosystem Mastery" - where you'll build your AI-enhanced knowledge system to:
â†’ capture everything important
â†’ find anything instantly and 
â†’ apply knowledge faster than ever.

Inaugural cohort starts April 28th. 
Early bird ends April 13th.

P.S. Oh - you came here for how I plugged these holes in my own knowledge system?

1. I formed a routine for continuous learning
2. I implemented my Second Brain where my knowledge is externalized
3. I truly leverage AI combined with my insights (not just generic things)

These three pillars form the foundation of what I teach in Learning Ecosystem Mastery.
