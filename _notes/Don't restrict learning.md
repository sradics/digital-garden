# Don't restrict learning

## Observation

+ Many employees do not invest enough (?) in learning
	+ Even restrictive learning budgets don't get used
+ To ask for a training often takes several steps and approvals. 
+ Getting reimbursed is cumbersome. Sometime people have to pay from their pockets first.
+ Companies I worked with worked with Learning budgets.
+ Individual learning is often not core to personal development programs in companies

## Orientation

+ ==employees don't invest in themselves==
	+ not enough financial support
	+ cumbersome process
	+ no time beside operational work
+ ==assumption== that removing budget restrictions leads to ==wild west learning==

## A way forward

+ ==Remove too strict learning budgets==. If someone wants to learn then foster and amplify. And provide some [[Simple Rules]] as guidance.

### Some Simple guidelines

+ ==Establish sharing of learnings== either within your team or even outside your company
	+ based on [[MOC Building a 2nd brain |building a 2nd brain]] the step of expressing is crucial for learning
+ Suggest to ==build a connection with company purpose, missing, OKR==. 
	+ This way learning can help the company innovate and further progress in direction operational excellence
+ Monitor yearly used learning investments and even share within company.
	+ It provides a social anchor and enables people to compare and adjust their investment
+ And ==celebrate increased learnings and share success stories== based on these learnings.

## Interesting approaches

+ ==Introduce a Day of Learning== and Innovation. At Blinkist we used one Friday per quarter that was especially dedicated to learning (either individually or in small free formed groups)
+ ==Make payment or reimbursement for learning super easy==. E.g. via services [Pleo](https://www.pleo.io/de) where everyone can work with individual virtual credit cards.
+ Provide ==simple access to knowledge==. Blinkist e.g. offers [BlinkistBusiness](https://www.blinkist.com/en/business?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=header) where employees get access to Key Insights from over 5000 non-fiction books and podcasts. This way one can get a fast overview on topics and take an informed decision on what to drill down.
