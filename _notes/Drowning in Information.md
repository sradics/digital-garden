Drowning in newsletters, starving for insights?  

â†’ I slashed my newsletters by 80%

Remember subscribing to that productivity newsletter?  
The leadership digest?  
That AI trends one?  

Now your inbox is a graveyard of unread wisdom.  
Sound familiar?  

I've been there. Hundreds of newsletters, minimal retention.  

Here's one truth to face:  
Information without implementation is just noise.  

But there's hope. Here's how I turned my newsletter chaos into compound knowledge:  

â†’ Audit ruthlessly  
Unsubscribe from 80%. Keep only the gems.  
I'm down to 25 newsletter and check monthly.

â†’ Set up a capture system  
I use Matter. 
I start to integrate more AI at this stage.

â†’ Schedule processing time  
15 minutes daily beats 2 hours never.  
(I love reading a newsletter, when I'm waiting in a queue)

â†’ Distill ruthlessly  
What's the ONE idea you can apply today?  
Via my Capture system only my highlights from Newsletter 
enter my System.

â†’ Connect and express  
Newsletters become idea seeds for my posts.
They spark new connections in my Second Brain.
Reading them hones my long-form and engaging writing skills.

The goal isn't to consume more.  
It's to build your knowledge flywheel.  

How many newsletters are you subscribed to?  
Drop a number in the comments!
