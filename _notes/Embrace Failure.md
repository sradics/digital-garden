Before You Spend 1 More Second Worrying

â†’ About Being Unprepared

When I started my first job after university, I faced huge challenges.
It was a fast-paced consultancy environment.
The expectations placed on me were overwhelming.

I lacked practical experience:

â†’ How to work with software frameworks.
â†’ How to communicate with clients.
â†’ How to deliver results. 

I really struggled ðŸ¤¯

But I chose to dive in and build my expertise!

â†’ Immersed in books for foundational knowledge
â†’ Worked 12-16 hours daily. Started with basics  
â†’ Became an expert in just a few weeks
â†’ Felt a sense of progress each day  
â†’ Got hooked by the success

Remember this:

â†’ Some dive into new roles and thrive.
â†’ Some dive into new roles and struggle.

â†’ Some take on extra work and excel.
â†’ Some take on extra work and burn out.

â†’ Some learn quickly and adapt.
â†’ Some learn quickly and still falter.

And some win bbut many lose because they are afraid to start.

Instead

â†’ do whatever it takes to achieve it
â†’ Learn from every failure
â†’ learn smarter
â†’ learn faster
