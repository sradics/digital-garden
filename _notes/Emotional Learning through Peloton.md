🚴‍♂️ Pedaling Through Breakthroughs: Energy and Ideas on My Peloton 💥  
  
It is the last 5 minutes of an intense 90-minute Peloton workout. Being exhausted and on the verge of closing the session, it happened.  
  
Matt played Darude-Sandstorm.  
Pure energy surged through my muscles. 🚴‍♂️  
250 Watts plus and 5 minutes of high intensity. 🔥  
  
At such a high, I experience a full range of emotions.  
Tears can flow, and I'm super connected. It was a moment of pure happiness.  
  
I find myself thinking through topics I focused on earlier.  
  
From “Learning How to Learn,” I learned about the FOCUSED and DIFFUSED modes of learning.  
  
On my Peloton, I tap into the diffused mode. When in diffused, I often find solutions to problems, new ideas, or emerging concepts.  
  
I design these Focused-Diffused sequences on purpose. Here is how:  
———  
→ Morning Routine:  
As a member of the 5AM club, I spend my first 3 hours in focused mode, writing and learning.  
  
→ Transition to Exercise:  
Without longer distractions, I get on my bike for about 60 minutes.  
During this time, my thoughts wander, and I connect them to my morning learning.  
  
→ Mental Link:  
When an important thought comes up, I decide to note it after my session.  
This keeps me accountable.  
  
→ Immediate Notes:  
Right after cycling, I jot down my thoughts.  
A new LinkedIn post idea, a contact to reach out to, or a product concept.  
  
To support your Focused and Diffused Modes:  
———  
✅ Ensure Smooth Transition:  
Ensure an easy switch from focused to diffused mode.  
I can get on my bike within 5 minutes, keeping my thought flow intact.  
  
✅ Choose Wandering-Friendly Activities:  
Choose an activity where your thoughts can wander.  

✅ Prepare Follow-Up Tools:  
Have your tools ready.  
Cycling near my creativity space, I can immediately follow up on my thoughts.  
Create a routine that blends focused and diffused modes.  

Have you experienced such magical moments of learning?  
If not yet, what is ONE thing you’d love to try?

## Content preparation

I did a 90 minute intense Peloton workout. And in the last 5 minutes, being exhausted, near to closing the session it happened. Matt played Darude-Sandstorm and it was like pure energy to my muscles. 250 Watts plus and 5 minutes of intensity. 

At such a high, I can sense a full range of emotions. It's when also tears show, when I feel super connected. It was a moment of being happy.

What I can sense during such longer fitness sessions, that I can think through topics I had a focus on before. From Learning how to Learn I got the concept of focused and diffused mode of learning. On my Peloton I tap into the diffused mode. It is often that I find a solution to a problem, that an idea shows, that a concept emerges.

And I create such moments with intention:
+ I write and learn in the morning. Being a member of the 5AM club I usually spent my first 3 hours in the morning with full writing and learning focused mode.
+ Without longer distractions I get on my bike afterwards. Usually 60 minutes. When thoughts wonder, I follow them a bit. I explore its connection to my previous learning. 
+ With a thought to keep I state my inner intention to take a note after the cycling session. This creates a mental link and accountability.
+ Immediately after a session, I take notes on thoughts that appeared. Sometimes it is a next LinkedIn post topic, a contact to reach out, a product idea

What are the special ingredient:
+ Make your transit+ Chose an activity where your thoughts can wander. Like on my Peloton, I can do the exercise and still have enough capacity to think, dream a bit and follow topics. 
+ Have your follow up tools prepared. As I'm cycling closed to my creativity space, I can immediately follow up.
+ Design your flow for combining focused and diffused mode.

Did you experience such magic moments of learning too?
If not yet, what is ONE thing, you would love to try?
