Your comments are my classroom:  
  
â†’ Here's how I'm turning engagement into expertise  
  
As my LinkedIn engagement increases,  
I'm discovering new learning opportunities.  
  
I'm actively learning from your comments.  
  
I categorize comments into:  
â†’ Positions for/against a topic I write about  
â†’ Adding an insight or your experience  
â†’ Encouragement for my work  
  
And I nurture all three categories  
â†’ To learn what resonates and what not  
â†’ To gain new insights  
â†’ To feel good  
  
Just yesterday, with the post "Small Tasks, B!G excuses," many of you provided great insights on what works for you. I'm grateful for that.  
  
(the post for reference: [https://lnkd.in/eJJsxHaE](https://lnkd.in/eJJsxHaE))  
  
You rock!  
  
I've begun capturing these valuable insights from your comments.  
  
This is my approach:  
â†’ While reading your comments, I add a new insights to my Daily Note  
This is quick and helps me stay focused as I go through comments and respond.  
  
â†’ Later, I review all captured insights and make notes.  
I use the Spark-Remark-Relate approach for that.  
(details: [https://lnkd.in/eX-wfw8q](https://lnkd.in/eX-wfw8q))  
  
I use these insights to:  
â†’ further develop my approach  
â†’ adjust my direction  
â†’ derive new posts  
  
There's a lot to gain from our conversations.  
For me, this exemplifies a Win:Win:Win:Win situation  
  
â†’ Hopefully, you win by gaining value from my thoughts  
â†’ LinkedIn wins by increased engagement  
â†’ Others learn from your comments too  
â†’ I win by learning from you  
  
It's worth engaging!  
  
Here's to more great growth and learning moments together.
