My 5 comments/day goal made me smile loftily

â†’ The moment you look back and see CHANGE
â†’ happened today morning when I realized
â†’ that I grew beyond my previous goal
â†’ of engaging with 5 comments/day

For six months I wrote content every day..
I experimented with various formats.
But Engagement did not take off. 

â†’ I read about the importance of engagement
â†’ I even set a goal of 5 comments/day
â†’ But I ignored it and favored writing
â†’ In hindsight, a big MISTAKE

When I joined Brand Built
I learned right from day one
âž  My Engagement was missing 

Even 5 comments/day would be far too few!

Now, I give about 40 comments/day. 
The impact was visible right from day one!

âž  Impressions grew by 45%
âž  Engagement grew by 300%
âž  I have high-value conversations daily

It is content + engagement that matIt took me while! Your impulse for a shortcut?

What is your ONE experience with engagement?
