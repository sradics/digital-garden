How I multiply the value of a conference  
  
â†’ instead of throwing 2 days away  
  
It is conference season!  
We join with high intentions.  
We gather insights, take notes, engage.  
We even get recordings and conference material.  
  
We CAPTURE a lot.  
  
But do we also organize, distill and most importantly express?  
  
Knowledge x Action = Power.  
  
No Action means Knowledge x 0 â‡¢ 0 Power.  
  
This is how I convert my 2d [hashtag#secondbrainsummit](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=secondbrainsummit&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7248980805547343872) insights to Power  
  
I took all my notes during session on my reMarkable.  
On my flight back from LA to Berlin I distilled.  
  
â†’ I highlighted main insights from each talk  
â†’ I added my questions, and derived follow ups  
â†’ I took time to reflect and connect my thoughts  
  
It is interesting to discover common themes.  
To aggregate from all talks.  
To link different insights.  
  
I recommend your actively post process and reflect.  
To work against the forgetting curve!  
  
So far, I derived:  
  
â†’ 16 next LinkedIn Posts  
â†’ took a deep dive on one topic  
â†’ have 4 deep reflection follow ups  
â†’ connected with 20 people recently, 50+ in total  
â†’ extracted exercises and approaches I'll use too  
  
Next steps:  
  
â†’ I still have some talks to run through.  
  
â†’ I integrate highlights in my Obsidian Second Brain  
  
â†’ Write the LinkedPosts  
You'll discover them during the next weeks.  
  
â†’Join the follow up activities we got during the summit.  
But I need to be careful to not over capture.  
  
What is ONE action converter you recommend?

I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease
