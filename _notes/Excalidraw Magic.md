Hook:

I'm using Obsidian as my main tool to implement my Second Brain. 
And you can extend Obsidian with a powerful visualizing component through the Excalidraw plugin. And that elevates note taking to a next level. 

Here are several awesome functionalities I leverage with Excelidraw:
+ create enriched MindMaps inside my note taking app
+ embed notes directly in a visual canvas - not can be dynamically embedded so that you always look at the current version
+ it stores the drawing as a readable markdown file - so e.g. mass updating text becomes possible
+ I can link from drawing to note and embed drawings in a note, dynamically
+ Excalidraw provides a lot of embedded script and a great icon library - so one can extend functionality quite well

So what I'm doing during a course I'm learning through:
* take notes per session
* collect main visuals and embed the notes as notes preview in an Excalidraw mindmap
* work with colors, connectors between ideas
