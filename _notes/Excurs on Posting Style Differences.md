# [[Excurs on Posting Style Differences]]
## LinkedIn Post
[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_marketing-success-hinges-on-understanding-activity-7254008516892323840-iRsP?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

Marketing success hinges on understanding your customer.  
  
I used this T-Sequence in version 1 of an A/B test  
  
Do you remember my recent A/B test?  
(details [https://lnkd.in/eDu4857z](https://lnkd.in/eDu4857z))  
  
Two similar posts, but with a significantly different structure.  
  
Do you know the Five Lightbulbs Marketing from [Billy Broas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billybroas/)?  
  
It is an awesome approach to do argumentation-based marketing.  
It is about always having the customer and their journey in mind.  
  
Super brief, the Five Lightbulbs:  
â†’ Lightbulb 1: Customer Status Quo  
â†’ Lightbulb 2: Things they've tried  
â†’ Lightbulb 3: Your approach  
â†’ Lightbulb 4: Your offer  
â†’ Lightbulb 5: Customer's new life  
  
These Five Lightbulbs shaped version 1 in the A/B test!  
  
Billy helped me analyze and rewrite version 1 â‡¢ [https://lnkd.in/epvaewtE](https://lnkd.in/epvaewtE)).  
  
  
The post has a clear structure with the intention to:  
  
â†’ Show that I understand you (LB1)  
In the post, I explained being overwhelmed with starting my business  
  
â†’ Paint a positive picture of where you might get (LB5)  
I remembered how learning works best and brought back structure.  
  
â†’ Teaser my solution to get you there (LB3)  
I briefly touched on the KEYS TO SUCCESS to master "Learning how to Learn".  
Do you remember my 3 pillars?  
  
âž  The mindset of learning  
âž  Creating high-impact outcomes  
âž  Leverage modern tools and approaches for learning  
  
â†’ Ask you for a next action (LB 4)  
I asked to join my next virtual MASTERCLASS called Effortless Learning, Lasting Results. Simple: Just comment "SmartLearner".  
  
It blew my mind, once I understood the structure:  
  
â†’ To create a tension by combining Status Quo and the better future.  
â†’ Then teaser a solution to resolve that tension.  
â†’ Closed by an invite to a concrete next step  
â†’ Billy calls that a T-Sequence  
  
Do you see the power of such a structured approach?  
  
What is ONE immediate thought?  
  
  
(Tomorrow I'll write about the results from the A/B test. See you?)  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
P.S.  
I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease
