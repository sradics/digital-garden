# Experience Emotional Writing
I faced a question about the topic digital gardening and why I would like to publish my thoughts. This time I took the time to ==externalize my thoughts via just writing== about it. Flushing it without thinking about formatting, proper phrasing and if what I'm writing is right or wrong or phrased in a not offending way.

I realized that ==I started with simple argumentation and rationalized the reasoning==. And I observed myself and noticed that I was feeling detached from my reasoning. **It felt like I was writing something to please the reader**. It was **on the surface and not really drilling down** to my real needs behind.

Connecting to my coaching experience ==I started to challenge my self==. Challenged to remove clutter. I asked myself: 
+ ==What do I really want to achieve by doing that?== 
+ ==And why is that important?== 

I ==observed my answers and included my body reactions==. In the beginning my answers still felt like a make up, like a lie. I could sense this in my body too. It was not really involved.  

**I forced myself to uncover it as a make up and asked again. Why is that important to me?** And for the answers ... Why is that important to me? 

==The more I drilled down the more I started sensing changes in my body.== It started feeling connected, authentic and it started showing. It got warm, I got enthusiastic and I was in a zone. Latest ==when I started crying during my writing I realized that I reached my emotions==. This was strong. 

And I immediately understood how **digital-gardening connects to my need of being seen, gaining social rewards and providing something valuable that gives me the feeling of being connected and *maybe* contributing something above my mere existence**.
