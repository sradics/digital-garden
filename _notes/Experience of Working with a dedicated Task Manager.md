## Content preparation
For a long time I did not have a clear approach for working with tasks. My task where scattered through different media like my note taking app, in Slack, in Confluence/Notion, on my Remarkable. And I mixed my tasks and my notes. 

A year ago I changed my approach an centralized my task management with Todoist and combined my task management approach with my Second Brain. 

My approach:
+ All my tasks are centralized in Todoist. Work related and private. All.
+ All systems where my tasks originate from are connected to my Todoist. When I realize a task from a Slack conversation, I create that task in Todoist directly from Slack. When I derive a task from an E-Mail, I create the task in Todoist in the E-Mail app. When I have a team shared task in Notion or Asana, that task is automatically mirrored to my Todoist.
+ I maintain the same project structure in my Task Manager that I use it in my Obsidian note taking app. I use PARA for organizing my Second Brain. The projects have the same naming across different tools. This way I can fast reference my tasks connected with a project and also all my notes connected with a project.
+ A task has a short description. And I link to detailed notes in my Second Brain that I might need to use with a task. This way I avoid duplications and maintain on source of truths for my information. 
+ I currently experiment with adding a value categorization from the $10k framework and with having a task assigned to an energy zone

Advantages:
+ I have all my tasks on one system and keep an overview easily.
+ I don't waste time and reduced my cognitive load for remembering the different locations for tasks
+ My tasks are not accessible and in sync at all my digital devices
+ Fast capturing tasks reduces efforts and leads to better behavior building for working with tasks
+ Connecting my task management with my Second Brain structure but splitting notes and tasks provides a clear separation of what becomes a long term note vs. what is an action I do take. It leverages the strengths of each system instead of forcing a note taking app to become a task manager or a task manager to become a note taking app.
