## Highlights
first stage of flow is “struggle,” as your brain situates to the environment and “loads” the information relevant to the task at hand. — location: [143](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FLQHLTK&location=143) ^ref-45357

---
If value created exceeds time/money, that is what’s known as a “very productive day.” — location: [161](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FLQHLTK&location=161) ^ref-2592

---
The “Energy School” offers a variety of ways to get that energy curve higher. — location: [165](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FLQHLTK&location=165) ^ref-19898

---
The “Focus School” is all about getting into and staying in flow. — location: [167](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FLQHLTK&location=167) ^ref-59180

---
The “Efficiency School” is obsessed with the logistics of work. — location: [170](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FLQHLTK&location=170) ^ref-24797

---
The real impact of breaking up our day into smaller segments is on flow, or the lack thereof: — location: [179](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FLQHLTK&location=179) ^ref-53702

---
We feel as if we’re interrupted from the current interruption by yet another interruption. — location: [182](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FLQHLTK&location=182) ^ref-13292

---
What if we saw the constant stimulation not as interruptions and distractions, but as opportunities for rich feedback and connection? — location: [185](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FLQHLTK&location=185) ^ref-49753

---
we deliver it in smaller chunks at more frequent intervals: — location: [193](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FLQHLTK&location=193) ^ref-56113

---
But tasks are not inventory — they are nothing but abstract units of organization. — location: [207](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FLQHLTK&location=207) ^ref-35597

---
The inventory of knowledge work is ideas. — location: [208](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FLQHLTK&location=208) ^ref-15718

---
What you are selling, as a “worker of knowledge,” are the ideas you’ve “processed” — location: [209](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FLQHLTK&location=209) ^ref-5677

---
requires changing not how we manage tasks and projects, but how we manage the information content of those projects. — location: [215](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FLQHLTK&location=215) ^ref-6973

---
conception of what we are producing, from final deliverables to what I will call “intermediate packets.” — location: [217](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FLQHLTK&location=217) ^ref-29924

---
we package up all the intermediate steps — the research, notes, brainstorms, examples, outlines, prototypes, drafts, and even crazy ideas we choose not to pursue — as reusable components for later consumption. — location: [218](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FLQHLTK&location=218) ^ref-20960

---
Productivity becomes a game of matching each available block of time with a corresponding packet of value. — location: [225](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FLQHLTK&location=225) ^ref-21065

Big, ambitious projects are risky, because all the time you spend on it will feel like a waste if you don’t succeed. — location: [228](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FLQHLTK&location=228) ^ref-40844

---
Organizing your work in intermediate packets has an extraordinary effect: you become interruption-proof. — location: [234](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FLQHLTK&location=234) ^ref-20712

---
This is because part of the “packaging up” of an intermediate packet is that it becomes legible — others — location: [240](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FLQHLTK&location=240) ^ref-6532

---
There seems to be a critical mass in a given industry or area — once you reach that mass, each additional packet added creates exponential value in the connections it creates with others. — location: [246](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FLQHLTK&location=246) ^ref-49590
