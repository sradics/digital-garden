# Extending Para  Notes
[Source](https://fractalproductivity.substack.com/p/paramore?ck_subscriber_id=1758824896)

PARA - organize things by actionability
Its organization is based on a spectrum from hot (more timely, relevant) to cold (less timely, relevant).

an **"organizational system for your whole digital life"**.

`Areas` has **containers for contemporary** _**life areas**_ (_these are domains like health, work, or family, where you have long-term responsibilities and/or want to maintain a certain standard_)

`Resources` has **containers for each of your** _**topics of**_ _**interest** (this is usually for more long-term reference materials_)

WIP stands for "Work In Progress". It refers to **the number of unfinished items at a given place at any given time**.

**limit the number of containers within each P.A.R.A. space.**
**7 projects, 21 areas, and 21 resources**

-   **I increase the project throughput** (while before I would collect more projects without making progress on any of them)
    
-   **I am forced to cancel ill-born projects** (while before I would keep zombie projects alive)
    
-   **I reduce congestion & bottlenecks** (while before I would keep too many never-ending projects)
    
-   **I review my life areas more often** (while before I would only add new areas but never retire old ones)
    
-   **I am forced to focus on the essential few** (while before I would lose focus by adding too many items)
    
-   **I do more house-keeping of my resources** (while before I would accumulate a never-ending pile of new references)


by adding custom spaces you also **risk its potency and clarity.**

## How to deal with bigger and hot topics that span several projects?
These "epics" are often too "hot" or short-lived to count as areas. They are also way too big to be just a single project. And if it's multiple related projects, how do I represent their connectedness and priority over everything else?

Whenever I run into these situations, I create what I call a [personal program](https://fractalproductivity.substack.com/p/the-personal-program).

That’s the name I give highly concentrated multi-project endeavors that last a couple of weeks to a few months and require all of my energy (next to my day job).

a _program_ is **a bundle of related projects, areas, and resources you are working on almost exclusively for many work sessions.**   *Comment: Also nicely relates to programs in a company* 

tackle one of them I create a temporary "hotter-than-project" space. So I’d go from P.A.R.A. to **P.P.A.R.A.**. I’d do that only _for the time of the program_ and then revert back to P.A.R.A. after the program is finished.

**1 — The program space is more actionable than your projects**, so it should be sorted/located _before_ projects. It should at least somehow stand out and give the impression of being more important than your projects.

## Tagging
In [Tagging is Broken](https://fortelabs.co/blog/tagging-is-broken) Tiago Forte points out that tags are ill-suited to replace folder hierarchies.

Tagging systems won't replace folder hierarchies, that’s right. But they can very well **supplement them.**

### Recommendations when working with Tags
[Source](https://fractalproductivity.substack.com/p/paramore-4-the-meta-layer?sd=pf)
+ reduce the upfront decision cost as much as possible
	+ "tagging triggers" woven into your workflows that tell you it is time to tag
+ remove the need to memorize tags
	+ tool creates tags for you completely automatically. Or some templates bring them in by default and you removed the ones not needed
	+ 1. use tagging conventions 2. use tagging hierarchies 3. use auto-complete features
+ separate tags from content and let tags evolve naturally
+ review & consolidate your system opportunistically
+ strive to make every tag count
+ choose a lightweight, antifragile approach to tagging

## Meta
+ **Containers growing too large for efficient navigation**
+ **Lacking an overview by item type.** What if you need an overview of all your book summaries or list all the checklists you have ever created?

## About capturing
[Source](https://fractalproductivity.substack.com/p/paramore-5-paria-unlocking-the-incubator)
A solid capture habit is worth a lot, but it can lead to a problem. It makes us prone to _**over-capture**; to keep more than we are able to use._

Use a heuristic like “**when in doubt, discard it.”**

To create my safe area / someday maybe empire I added a 5th _space_ to my P.A.R.A. I called it my "incubator" since stuff there is lingering and waiting to be born.
*Comment:* I achieve that my taking smart notes and adding such things to fleeting notes that I will then further process.

## About Inbox management
[Source](https://fractalproductivity.substack.com/p/paramore-6-inbox-management)
That's why I deem it legit to consider the inbox as a hidden space of P.A.R.A. (think **i.P.A.R.A.**)

*Comment:* I actually using my Fleeting Notes folder as my inbox and this works just fine and is in alignment with  [[How to Take Smart Notes]].

![[Pasted image 20230208065738.png]]

Some advanced users may be able to actually ever only inbox triage _opportunistically_ based on how they feel about the current contents.

A third way you can approach it is what I call **Inbox Kanban**. Here you triage based on the number of items the inbox contains.
