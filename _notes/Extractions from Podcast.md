*Guy Podjarny*

+ **thinking outside the box - challenge status quo**
+ work in **high intensity surrounding**
+ **when you're comfortable you're not growing** (no growth without pain)
+ need to **learn things very quickly**
+ selling with believe in the product and not deal making

* break things down and **extract main principles**, find **fundamentals**
	* then relate that to needs 
	* and grow thinking from there, build on those components
* **anchoring in the future** ... in fives years time, would that be more or less necessary, and why
	* starts with asking that question
	* steers to invest appropriately
	* pick a different idea if you can't strongly argue about 5 years time
* marketing timing in about 2 years
* **big vision, small steps** - don't get stuck in a step, get going
* drill down on the market size?
	* need to access to potential value proposition market size
	* investors need to have a market size figure in there
	* so think though that and walk them through you market size argumentation
* focus on magnitude of value ... and then derive $value from there. (? not clear what that means)
* **it matters to be a leader in a market**, it is not that much about being first in a market
	* **differentiation** in the market matters
* **use messaging** to build the right product
	* message forces to **distill the customer need**, precise to the core points
	* leads to higher focus
	* translate to a customer need and understand their experience end-2-end
	* **think about the entire use case**
	* **==nobody cares about your product - they care about the problem you're solving==**
	* market evolves, product evolves, needs evolve - so messaging has to adapt
* develop fast, stay secure
* **you can't be everything to everyone** - have a precise picture of needs and the group with that needs
	* pick a small/big enough slice and focus on that and then evolve from there
* ask and try to **understand why something is not working**
* Movement will go further in directions of **team empowerment**. So they will increase their buying power for tools/topics in future. Over time.
	* **product led, empowerment based and user focus solutions**
	* help users to communicate with their buyers and help the buyers understand the use case
	* what is of **main importance is the value to the user**
* reversion back to bundling
	* driven by cost savings
* **what is our primary value proposition?**
	* for productivity - how can you directly show that
* **low frequency - high pain: you need high presence**
* **high frequency - low pain: reduce effort of picking solution** must be small (lower the friction)
* **low frequency, low pain - should just be a feature**
* **7 powers framework** - how do you deliver value to a customer
	* How do you deliver a sustainable, superior, significant value
	* calling it power instead of moat
* Defensibility in early stages?
	* in the beginning you cant (except with exceptional knowledge, significant set of skill)
	* Critical: How can that build something that can become defensible
	* Defensibility
		* Network
		* Data
		* Switching cost
		* Counterpositioning to other industry
		* Inception
		* Legal protection
* In the **beginning 90% of focus should be on finding product market fit** and then think about 7 powers. Have a rough idea on the powers.
* **PMF**
	* when ==**demand outweighs capacity**== to satisfy (e.g. can't hire, spin up fast enough)
	* product user fit to - get to the value AND product buyer fit - the business model that works
	* who is it that you provide value for
	* Speed of execution - the **speed of iteration to accelerate speed of learning**
		* at the same time, iterate in the **right direction**
* Qualities of power (you know where to invest)
	* Brand power - sell same product for significant higher price because of pride in product
	* Process power
	* Counterpositioning - Product Led Growth
* Exercise - take **4 primary competitor capabilities and write down how you differentiate from that**
	* what capabilities can you build and which ones are superior,...
	* in 5 years from now ...
	* distill in top 1..2 top items
* 7 powers help to drive focus on where to invest, pick the next thing to do. Which of our powers help with the extension. What are our core market differentiators
* design partners - early customer that help you shape the product
* investing
	* put a lot in due diligence
	* invest for the learning
	* mistake: investing in things that are obvious
* **When you have a good idea, you are likely not the only one! You better get going**
* Do not hire too big, too early

## The 7 Powers framework
The "7 Powers" framework is a strategic framework developed by Hamilton Helmer. 
Book: 7 Powers - The Foundations of Business Strategy.

The 7 Powers framework identifies seven fundamental sources of power that can contribute to a company's long-term success and competitive advantage. These powers are as follows:

1.  Scale Economies: The ability to achieve lower costs and higher margins through economies of scale as the business grows.
    
2.  Network Economies: The value and advantage derived from having a large network or ecosystem of users, customers, suppliers, or partners.
    
3.  Counterpositioning: The ability to occupy a unique and advantageous position in the market that is difficult for competitors to replicate or challenge.
    
4.  Process Power: The power derived from superior processes, systems, or technologies that enable efficient and effective operations.
    
5.  Branding Power: The strength of a recognized and respected brand that can command premium pricing, customer loyalty, and competitive advantage.
    
6.  Cornered Resources: The control or ownership of scarce or unique resources, such as essential inputs, intellectual property, or distribution channels.
    
7.  Switching Costs: The costs or barriers that make it difficult or costly for customers to switch to a competitor, thus creating customer loyalty and reducing churn.
