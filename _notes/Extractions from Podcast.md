	* market evolves, product evolves, needs evolve - so messaging has to adapt
* develop fast, stay secure
* **you can't be everything to everyone** - have a precise picture of needs and the group with that needs
	* pick a small/big enough slice and focus on that and then evolve from there
* ask and try to understand why something is not working
