5 Dangerous Myths About Facilitation  
  
â†’ That Sabotage Your Training Impact  
  
They're the invisible misconceptions  
that limit your effectiveness before you even begin.  
  
â†’ After 16 years facilitating workshops  
â†’ After observing my and many others struggle  
â†’ After transforming my own approach through 4MAT  
  
Here are 5 myths holding us back:  
  
**Myth 1: Good content automatically creates good learning**  
Reality: Brilliant content fails without considering how people actually process information.  
  
â†’ Expertise means nothing if participants can't integrate it.  
  
**Myth 2: One facilitation approach works for everyone**  
Reality: Design for only one learning style and you unconsciously alienate up to 75% of your participants.  
  
â†’Different brains need different pathways.  
  
**Myth 3: Engagement equals effectiveness**  
Reality: High energy and positive feedback often mask poor knowledge retention.  
  
â†’ True effectiveness is measured by lasting behavioral change.  
  
**Myth 4: More content equals more value**  
Reality: Information overload kills retention. Participants typically remember only 10% when you prioritize quantity over processing time.  
  
â†’ Less content, deeply processed, creates more impact.  
  
**Myth 5: Facilitation is about performance**  
Reality: The best facilitators aren't performers...  
  
âž  They're architects of learning experiences who understand the natural learning cycle.  
  
What if there was a systematic approach to facilitation  
that addressed all these myths?  
  
That's exactly what we'll explore in our upcoming 4MAT Mastering Training Design course in Hamburg (May 14-16, 2025), co-facilitated by [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAABu4oIBhM9AaaXVclPPngaKlvVKKy-FogU)[Hanne Houbak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanne-houbak-4aa5252/), the European trainer for 4MAT, and myself.  
  
Comment "4MAT" or send me a DM for more details about the course.  
(We're now filling seats for this transformative experience)
