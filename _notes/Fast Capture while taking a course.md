How I Fast-Track Key Insights During Online Courses ‚ö°Ô∏è  
(save time, extend thoughts, stay in the context)  
  
Ever watched a live presentation packed with valuable slides, but you can't access the deck later? üòì¬†I used to waste time manually transcribing the text.  
  
Now, I have a seamless solution using  
ChatGPT4 combined with Smart Connect Obsidian GPT.  
  
3 Simple Steps:  
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  
1Ô∏è‚É£ Capture: Screenshot the slide. (I use Mac's built-in tool)  
  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Extract: Paste the screenshot into Smart Connect Obsidian GPT  
and prompt: "Extract text and create note"  
  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Integrate: Copy the extracted text into your existing notes,  
or start a new Obsidian note  
  
Benefits:  
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  
‚Ü≥ Multitasking: Keep watching the video while your notes are generated  
‚Ü≥ Deeper Learning: Ask ChatGPT follow-up questions  
(like "What else should I know about this?") to tap into my Second Brain knowledge.  
  
This simple method lets me effortlessly capture and expand on what I'm learning. üôå

## Content preparation
When I learn through an Online Course I work with a routine of taking extensive notes already while running through the course. To streamline my note making I leverage AI for capturing insights. 

Concrete scenario - I'm watching a workshop or online live presentation that contains slides and I want to extract the text to make a note from it (Slides are not available).  In the past I manually wrote the text to my note. 

Now I use ChatGPT4o combined with Smart Connect Obsidian.
3 simple steps:
+ take a screenshot from the slide (on Mac I use the native Screenshot app)
+ paste to ChatGPT Smart Connect Obsidian with the simple prompt: extract text and create note
+ copy the text to your note (or use it directly as a new note and link it)

Smart Connect Obsidian GPT now extracts the text and creates a new note in my Obsidian with the text.

I can do that even in parallel. So I continue with the video and the note capturing is being processed in parallel. 

Cool extension - I can just ask: "What else should I know about it?" It looks for more information in my notes in my Second Brain. 
With: "And independent from my notes, what else should I know about topic maps?" it looks for wider information, that I might add to the note too.

In simple steps I can capture in insight, extend it with further information from my notes and from available world knowledge and enrich my learning about a topic.
