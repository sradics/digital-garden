## Content preparation

In the past 5 years I learned a lot. And I worked in many different roles. Being able to learn about a new topic fast and with a sufficient level of understanding was crucial. 

To illustrate, let's look at some roles I supported from:
+ building on my Agile coach, lead, master background I started as Agile Coach
+ I extended with a more strategic and company wide perspective and learned about Strategy. Some aspects - Wardley Mapping, Blue Ocean Strategy, Good Strategy-Bad Strategy and more. In addition the topic of Value Stream Mapping was crucial for finding the right spots to support
+ During that journey I discovered the importance of considering the Product Development Lifecycle more holistically. The topic of Continuous Discovery Habits by Teresa Torres became the next big field for upskilling. I became a Product Coach. Teams picked up fast and speed of iterations and learnings increase (remember Link, David)
+ Throughout my journey with team I developed a strong approach for facilitating efficient working sessions. I designed and led many workshops. This combination of design, facilitation and passion for learning brought me to my next role as Course Designer. I was leading teams in the past. This provided a spot to develop many well received leadership trainings that were executed as group based coaching sessions (I had to work in a great team with Caroline, Angie, Carla and awesome Coaches to name Katharina, Abby, Verena)

Speed of learning mattered a lot. And it increased heavily. My main speed amplifiers were:
+ Integrating AI throughout my Learning approach
+ Growing a stack of knowledge building blocks. Like Lego bricks. And using these blocks for growing compounding knowledge.
+ Understanding how Learning works. And transferring my understanding to my own learning but also to designing courses.

In many situations it felt overwhelming. I star
Now I'm on my path to build QuintSmart to support you in your learning journey. With tailored approaches for smarter, faster learning in your own pace.

Are you facing a challenge to adjust your knowledge too?
Would you benefit from adjusting faster and retaining more?
