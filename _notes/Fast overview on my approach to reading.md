I've spent 100+ hours perfecting my reading system. 

â†’ 5 steps that you can steal it in 5 minutes:  
  
1) Choose wisely  
â†’ Use fractal reading to decide what's worth your time  
â†’ Scan metadata, sources, and summaries to gauge interest quickly  
  
2) Highlight strategically  
â†’ Focus on content that connects to your current projects  
â†’ Challenge your assumptions  
â†’ Represent core concepts  
  
3) Extract efficiently  
â†’ For Kindle books: Export highlights directly  
â†’ For physical books: Use AI-powered tools or a custom Python script to digitize insights  
  
4) Go beyond AI summaries  
â†’ Combine your personal highlights with AI processing  
â†’ Create tailored, valuable summaries  
  
5) Read consistently  
â†’ Even as a slow reader, I aim for one book per week  
â†’ My secret? 5 AM reading sessions using the Pomodoro Technique  
  
I learned that is it is not about speed.

It's about consistency and creating the right environment for deep focus.
