How I Make Reading Books 7x More Effective ðŸ“šðŸ’¡  
  
Do you find yourself forgetting most of what you read?  
I used to struggle with this too, but then I discovered a system that supports knowledge retrievalÂ and skyrockets my retention by 7-9 times.  
  
Hereâ€™s how I applied it to the book Simple Marketing for Smart People  
(by [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAADIwlUBRzxXl9jQaCOCKhUAm_B_BF8XDYg)[Billy Broas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billybroas/) Broad and [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAKCWZYB0BJT397p4ZgCANFOp93epEb3djc)[Tiago Forte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiagoforte/)).  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’Capture: I read the book on Kindle, highlighting key points as I go. This took about 6-8 hours.  
  
â†’Organize & Distill: I exported the highlights to Obsidian and  
spent 20 minutes bolding the crucial points and highlighting essential insights.  
  
â†’Distill: I created a PDF of my refined notes and fed it into Gemini.  
Gemini helped summarize and format the notes, focusing on the bold and highlighted sections.  
  
â†’Express: Using my distilled notes, I completed tasks for the 5 Lightbulbs course andÂ worked on my argumentation for QuintSmart, adding new insights and examples along the way.  
  
ðŸ’¡This semi-automated process allows me to retain 70-90% of what I read,  
compared to just 10% from reading alone.  
  
Main components used:  
â†’Kindle for capturing and highlighting  
â†’Obsidian for organizing notes using PARA and Zettelkasten principles  
â†’Gemini for summarizing and formatting notes  
  
By investing just 25% more effort than simply reading,  
I transform information into actionable knowledge.  
  
Isnâ€™t this a much better leverage of your reading time?  
Whatâ€™s your approach to retaining knowledge?

([[Notes from Simple Marketing for Smart People|details for Belief-Claim-Proof]])
Belief: *I can be much faster in processing a book when I leverage CODE and AI* 
Claim: *With an optimized book processing pipeline I safe time and ensure knowledge retention* 
Proof: *Comparison of times needed and outcomes (logos)* 
Format: *Text + Image* 

I'm much faster in working with books leveraging my C.O.D.E stack
(combined with 7-9 times higher knowledge retention)

Do you also forget most of what you read? I struggled with that too but then I implemented a system that supports knowledge retrieval.

Here is how it works (slides provide you some visual impressions):
+ I read the book on Kindle with taking highlights while reading (estimated reading time 6-8h, Capture) 
+ I went through the highlights exported from Kindle to Obsidian and did a Second Step - bolding important aspects and yellow highlights the essential insights (took about 20 min, distill)
+ Export as Pdf and feed that to Gemini. Work with Gemini on summarizing my highlight. Especially taking bold and yellow highlights into consideration. (distill)
+ I aggregate these insights in my distilled literature note in parallel to working with Gemini on further drilling down on aspects. (took about 1h) (distill)
+ I started using my distilled note already today to do my homework for the 5 Lightbulbs course and to work on my argumentation for QuintSmart (express)
+ While working with my distilled literature note I add more examples, extend the note with insights and add questions. (capture)

My approach builds on this Capture-Organize-Distill-Express stack:
+ Reading and Highlighting in Kindle
+ Obsidian for note taking and connection to Kindle via Obisidian plugin
+ Organizing principle PARA blended with Zettelkasten - book highlights become a Literature note in an area
+ Export highlight note as Pdf to import in Gemini 1.5 Advanced. Gemini has a larger context window and can process the full Pdf
+ Leveraging Gemini-AI also for text formatting (e.g. as bulletpoints)

This semi-automated book processing approach enables me to manifest learnings from books with just about 25% more effort than just reading it. Compared to the rate of forgetting from simply reading that is about 90% (so I retain just about 10%). I can increase my retention to 70%-90% though experiencing and doing the "real thing".

Isn't that a much better leverage? What do you think?

Looking forward to your comments about your current approach and/or what you would like to try next.
