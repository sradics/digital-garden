# Fast usage of Matter

While taking notes and doing a quick research I just tried to Matter the page and do fast scan of the resource and just do some highlighting while reading. Directly in the Web page using the Chrome Matter plugin.

With creating some highlights this also enable fetching the Matter highlights to Obsidian via the Matter plugin.

Workflow to integrate the *mattered*  page:
+ Open research page in Chrome Browser and highlight main pages relevant for current note
+ Sync matter within Obisidian
+ Open [[S01 Personal/030-039 Areas/32 Zettelkasten/Matter/Matter]] page and check for new entry
+ Link new entry in the current note

- [ ] Create a better entry point to link to CODE - here I do need an entry point to Capture

# Linking
+ [[MOC Building a 2nd brain]]
