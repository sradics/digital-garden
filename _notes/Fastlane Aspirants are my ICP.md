The Compounding Secret Sidewalkers Will Never Understand  
  
â†’ The Fastlaner's Unfair Advantage  

With yesterday's post about time being the most undervalued resource,  
I found a hunch that I did not understand so far.  
  
(You can find the post here: [https://lnkd.in/erK78hx8](https://lnkd.in/erK78hx8)),  
  
My Ideal Customers are the ones who understand the finite nature of time.  
  
Following DeMarco's great differentiation between Sidewalkers, Slowlaners and Fastlaners, my ICP are the Fastlaners and aspirants.  
  
Fastlaners and Aspirants value time.  
  
They pick approaches that allow faster iterations.  
Approaches that use time wisely.  
  
As a short recap:  
â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Sidewalkers  
  
Sidewalkers often engage in poor financial management, prioritizing immediate gratification over long-term stability, leading to perpetual financial instability.  
  
â†’ Slowlaners  
  
Slowlaners trade time for money in traditional employment, relying on steady but slow-growing investments, leading to a safe but potentially limited financial future.  
  
â†’ Fastlaners  
  
Fastlaners focus on creating scalable businesses and systems that generate significant wealth rapidly and give them control over their financial futures.  
â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”  
  
Learning how to learn is the fuel for your flywheel to building your fastlane.  

When you learn how to learn  
â†’ you can accelerate every step on your path to become a Fastlaner  
  
â‡¢ you can iterate faster  
â‡¢ you can build on previous learnings  
â‡¢ you grow a compounding stack of projects insights  

Bad news:  
â€”â€”â€”  
I don't support Sidewalkers.  
They just don't get the importance of compounding effects.  
  
Investing in proper approaches to learning is for creating compounding effects.  
Game over. Respawn please, then I can help you.  

Bad news:  
â€”â€”â€”  
I don't support sleepy Slowlaners.  
In cozy jobs, still thinking that job security is a thing.  
Still thinking that saving some money and looking forward to their retirement in 20+ years is the thing.  
  
Good news:  
â€”â€”â€” || â€”â€”â€”  
If you're reading this, you're likely neither of the above.  
  
Learning to learn is for you, but only when:  
  
â†’ You want to further develop yourself  
â†’ You understand the power of compounding effects  
â†’ You want to break free and build your own path to freedom  
  
You think about the Fastlane?  
Or perhaps you're already on your fastlane  
but haven't yet optimized your learning approach?  
  
Be my guest.  
  
Time is too precious to spend sidewalking or slowlaning.  
Are you ready to shift gears?  

â€”â€”â€”  
P.S.  
I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease
