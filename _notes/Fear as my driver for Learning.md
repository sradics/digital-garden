I found fear to be my driver for Learning

â†’ But that might need a change
â†’ As I found better? drivers

I revisited my learning spark.

â†’ It was 1996. It was a family tragedy.
â†’ It thrust me from teenage to adulthood.
(can't share the details, it is too deep)

It also cause a moment of financial anxiety.

I had to find my way to contribute! 

I had to perform. I had to LEARN FAST.


Fear of falling behind drove my learning.
Not Joy, not exploration, not fun - FEAR.

What should I say, fear served me well! 

â†’ I finished my studies
â†’ I landed a well paid job
â†’ I got stability, felt secure

Over time, my learning drivers changed:

â†’ I got recognition > driver: Status 
â†’ I found myself > driver: Self-actualization
â†’ I Learned how to Learn > found the driver JOY

Is one driver better than others?
â‡¢ Should You replace fear as driver?
â‡¢ Should it be JOY, alone?

I don't think so!

Instead of replacing fear as driver

âž  I let them all coexist

Like in the movie "Inside Out":

"Each emotion helped Riley, navigate life's challenges, showing that all feelings are valuable and necessary for personal growth and well-being."

What drove ONE of your recent learnings?
