# Feedforward - A Future-Focused Twist on Feedback
![[Pasted image 20231130182925.png|400]]
We often look back to improve, basing our changes on past actions. But what if we flipped the script, focusing on the future instead of the past? Welcome to the concept of Feedforward.  
  
Consider this example: Instead of asking, "How do you perceive my leadership?" you'd ask, "I aim to devote more time to leadership tasks. How can I delegate my most frequent operational tasks within the next eight weeks?"  
  
Here are 10 reasons why Feedforward can be an effective tool:  
âœ¹ Embrace Change: Feedforward encourages us to envision a positive future, rather than dwelling on an unchangeable past.  
âœ¹ Promote Positivity: Guiding someone towards being right is more effective than proving they were wrong.  
âœ¹ Tailored for Success: Successful individuals tend to prefer constructive ideas that help them achieve their goals.  
âœ¹ Universal Input: Anyone aware of the task can offer Feedforward, creating a diverse pool of improvement ideas.  
âœ¹ Less Personal: Feedforward focuses on future actions, which tend not to be taken as personally as feedback on past actions.  
âœ¹ Encourage Growth: Feedforward supports potential for future change, unlike feedback, which can reinforce past failures.  
âœ¹ Widely Accepted: People are generally more receptive to positive suggestions for the future than critiques of the past.  
âœ¹ Covers Key Points: Feedforward can address the same issues as feedback but in a constructive, forward-looking manner.  
âœ¹ Efficiency: Offering ideas for the future without debating the past saves time and maintains the focus on improvement.  
âœ¹ Collaborative Tool: Feedforward fosters a sense of partnership, avoiding the hierarchy implied in traditional feedback.  
  
The shift from feedback to Feedforward can feel liberating and empowering. It's a way to harness the potential we all have for growth, improvement, and positive change.
