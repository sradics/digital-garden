# Find your Ikigai

> [!note] Meaning of the word Ikigai
> Ikigai translates to **==Value or Meaning of life==**.
> Ikigai for sparking hope.

Finding purpose and fulfillment in life can be found in the little things. Ikigai is a concept that originates from Japanese culture and philosophy. It is often described as "the reason for being" or "the reason to wake up in the morning."

## A great writing prompt to be mindful of the small things in life

Reflect on the past two days. What small but meaningful moments did I experience? What did I almost overlook?

Extend by: What was the origin of that item? How was I feeling then?

My example:[[Working on my Ikigai]]

## Leverage an unfair advantage taken from a disadvantage

I have felt, been through. ...  
Which will help me do, feel, experience ...

"No one has a personality structure like mine,

has had experiences like mine and

no one has felt and thought what I felt & thought.

Giving expression to that through

________ something no one else can do but me."

## To what question is Ikigai the answer to?
+ What do I leave behind?
+ Ikigai as a way to explore that
+ Motoki Tonn
+ Great model for my career development

	+ can be also a good filter for note-taking
