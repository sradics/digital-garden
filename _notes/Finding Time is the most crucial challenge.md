# [[Finding Time is the most crucial challenge]]
## LinkedIn Post
[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_ive-identified-4-common-learning-roadblocks-activity-7313078015452676096-XPQ-?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAA1M1pkBgWCYPhT45EpfLiHzViQqRWNCIv4)

__Finding Time__ topped the list when I asked:  
"What's your biggest challenge when it comes to learning?"  
  
(See poll results: [https://lnkd.in/eU3qNddy](https://lnkd.in/eU3qNddy))  
  
What if I show you a massive time-saving approach you can leverage:  
â†’ With each new learning  
â†’ For every book/podcast/video you consume  
â†’ In preparing every presentation/workshop/talk  
  
BUT here's the catch:  
â†’ You need to invest time initially  
  
It's about investing time now to save a lot of time in the future.  
(Think: Invest money now for greater returns later)  
  
Many face this tricky situation:  
"Cutting trees with a dull axe" instead of "sharpening the axe" first.  
  
So, let me ask you:  
â†’ What time investment would you make to save months (or even years) of your lifetime?  
  
Is a 1:10 ratio good? (1 month invested : 10 months saved)  
Or is 1:5 enough? (1 month invested : 5 months saved)  
  
What's your take? Share in the comments!  
  
P.S. Curious about my time-saving learning system?
