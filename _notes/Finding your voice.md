I thought AI would kill my authentic voice.  
  
â†’ Turns out it helped me find it.  
  
After 9 weeks of analyzing 270,000 words of my own conversations, I discovered something fascinating about AI and authenticity.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
Here's what most people get wrong:  
They think AI will make their writing sound generic.  
  
But here's what they're missing:  
AI can become your most powerful mirror.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
The breakthrough came from a simple realization:  
  
My real voice emerged when I was just talking.  
  
Not when I was straining over a keyboard.  
Not when I was trying to sound "professional."  
  
When I was explaining ideas to a friend.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
So I built something that names itself "Lexicon":  
  
â†’ First: I compiled 10,000 words of writing knowledge  
(frameworks, principles, techniques)  
  
â†’ Second: I analyzed months of my natural speech patterns  
  
â†’ Third: I fed both to AI to create my personal writing mentor  
  
â†’ Fourth: Now it coaches me back to authenticity while applying good writing principles  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
The result?  
  
Instead of generic AI writing, I get writing that sounds more like me than I ever managed before.  
  
The AI doesn't replace my voice.  
It amplifies what was already there.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
This reveals a bigger pattern for using AI in any area:  
  
1. Define the knowledge you need  
  
2. Let AI synthesize and organize it  
  
3. Add your unique personality and experience  
  
4. Build your personal AI assistant from that combination  

â€”â€”â€”  
  
The irony is beautiful:  
The more I use AI, the more authentically "me" my writing becomes.  
  
It's not about AI doing the work for you.  
It's about AI helping you do your best work.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
What knowledge could you combine with your authentic voice to create your own AI-powered evolution?  
  
Ready to discover your authentic voice through AI?  
  
DM me or comment "VOICE" and I'll share the exact framework I used.

P.P.S Video done via  
1) Fed Notebook LM with my Newsletter and asked for a short audio overview  
2) Gave that audio overview to Descript to create this video  
3) Recorded me scrolling through the newsletter (another video layer)  
4) Recorded me listening to the video (the video layer showing me)  
5) Recorded Lexicon in action (the small overlay in the middle)  
  
Tooling: Descript (Video), Notebook LM (Audio and script), Lexicon (Writing Part 1), Obsidian (Writing)
