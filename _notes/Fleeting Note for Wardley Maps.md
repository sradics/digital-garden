**Maps:**

-   **Space has a meaning**
-   **You have an anchor (e.g. like where is north)**
-   **(e.g. a systems overview is not a map but a diagram)**
-   **„Maps“ in business are mainly not a map but a diagram**
-   **Anchor: can be the customer**
-   **Customer and create a chain of needs for that customer down to the low level system components**
