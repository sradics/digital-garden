# Flow inside PARA and Zettelkasten
What helped me a lot was the  [[About my usage of Fleeting Notes, Permanent notes and Literature Notes|distinction between types of notes]](Fleeting Notes, Literature Notes, Permanent Notes). And I blend these types alongside with PARA.

For PARA I'm working with folders. The note type is in each note via a Tag.

This way I can fast access my own developed thoughts (Permanent Notes - depending on when I'm using them in Projects, Areas, Resources or even Archives) and where they got derived from (Literature Notes, also PARA depending when I use them). I can bundle them to bigger topics (Index notes).

Like described in [[Building a Second Brain and the Zettelkasten Method]]... this helps me to add the layer of [[Essay - The CODE to leverage the effect of compounding knowledge|compounding knowledge ]]combined with BASB actionability and project flow.

Lastly I would also like to access the [[Maturity Model for my Obsidian Notes|maturity of my notes/my thoughts]]. This helps me to increase quality over time and also with fast decisions on reliability. Especially when I [[BASB - Learning about Express|EXPRESS]] through my notes, the maturity comes in handy to pick parts to combine and also is a stage where I further increase maturity levels of touched notes.
