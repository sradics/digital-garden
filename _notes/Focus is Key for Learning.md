My Struggle with Distractions and How I Overcame It  
(Unlock the Power of Deep Focus)  
  
Let me switch on my learning music! 🎵  
I open another browser tab and notice an interesting topic I still have open. Let me take a quick look. Ah, great—an article I recently opened but haven’t read yet. I’ll just scan through it quickly. Great information here! Zooming in now…  
  
20‼️ minutes later,  
I snap back to reality.  
I let my attention wander.  
I engaged with distractions 😫  
  
Do you know that feeling?  
  
For efficient learning, FOCUS is key!  
  
Ready to master deep focus?  
Here’s a method that works for me:  
  
🔹 Prepare Your Space: Gather all materials you might need.  
🔹 Cut Distractions: Remove anything that could pull your attention away.  
⏳ Set a Timer: Commit to working without distractions for 30 minutes.  
🔹 Extend If You Can: Add another 15 to 60 minutes if you feel like it.  
(Chances are, you will!)  
☕️ Take a Break: After 90 minutes, take a focused break for 10-15 minutes.  
🔁 Repeat: Keep this cycle going.
