My 10-day Pomodoro experiment is revealing surprising results

â†’ Confession: I resisted taking breaks until this

My challenge:
â€”â€”â€”
I want to have better focus and steer my daily time investments.

My PACT:
â€”â€”â€”
Use a daily Pomodoro sequence using Session for the next 10 days until 16.03.

The Pomodoro approach briefly explained
â€”â€”â€”
1) Set a session goal - what would you like to achieve in the next 25'
2) Fokus for 25' .. then do a 5' break
3) Repeat up to 4 times. Then do a longer break

Think of it as interval training for your brain - 
short bursts of focused work followed by recovery periods.

My HOW:
â€”â€”â€”
I use the app Session for my Pomodoros.
Session:
â†’ Has great timer with 25' sessions and 5' breaks
â†’ Works on desktop and mobile
â†’ Keeps a session journal

This is one example Pomodoro sequence that I use
for my daily morning LinkedIn writing:

â†’ 25' commenting and tracking for my post ... 5' break
â†’ 25' writing ... 5' break
â†’ 25' polishing and publishing ... 5' break
â†’ 25' commenting and high intensity engagement ... 30' break

My first impressions:
â€”â€”â€”
â†’ I'm even more focussed. This structure helps.
â†’ Session is fun to work with and delivers on it's promise.
â†’ In 25' I create small outcomes and have a sense of progress.

My challenges:
â€”â€”â€”
â†’ Breaks when in flow. Stopping after 25' is tough. 
At the same time I can feel the consequences when I don't take breaks.

â†’ Thinking about an outcome I want to achieve in 25'
I believe this is a matter of daily practice.

Do you use the Pomodoro technique too? 
What is one insight you can share?
