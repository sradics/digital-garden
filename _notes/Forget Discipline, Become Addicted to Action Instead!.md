## Highlights
* get addicted to taking action & success!
* The issue with this is that the **action** and the **results** you get from it are too far away from each other.
* your mind does not make the same connection that it would if you got the reward immediately.
* **celebrate your actions!** Whenever youâ€™re doing something that brings you closer to your goals, take a moment to recognize that as a major win!
* put a big grin on my face and acknowledge the work Iâ€™ve just done.
* This has helped me get excited about the right actions!
