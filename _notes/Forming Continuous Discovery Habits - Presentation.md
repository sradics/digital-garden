# Forming Continuous Discovery Habits - Presentation


![[FormingContinuousDiscoveryHabits.pdf]]
## Background
I gave that presentation on [[2023-03-09_Thu]] on [Agile Get Together](https://www.agile-gt.com/details-registrierung/how-to-form-continuous-discovery-habits-at-blinkist-expert-talk) as Expert talk.

I used Obsidian Advanced Slides plugin for the presentation and implemented the presentation directly in Obsidian. Slide-Flow was prepared using Obsidian's Canvas - ![[Flow.canvas]]
