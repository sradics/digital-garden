# Forming Continuous Discovery Habits - Presentation

![[FormingContinuousDiscoveryHabits.pdf]]

## Background

I gave that presentation on [[2023-03-09_Thu]] on [Agile Get Together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XviSbwj39Ds&t=61s) as Expert talk.

I used Obsidian Advanced Slides plugin for the presentation and implemented the presentation directly in Obsidian. Slide-Flow was prepared using Obsidian's Canvas - ![[Flow.canvas]]
