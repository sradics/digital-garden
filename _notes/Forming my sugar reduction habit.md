"Absorb what is useful, discard what is useless and add what is specifically your own â€” Bruce Leeâ€œÂ encapsulates my journey away from added sugar.  
  
Here's how I regained control:  
âœ…Conscious Choices: Daily decisions keep me free from added sugars  
âœ…Smart Shopping: I scrutinize labels to avoid hidden sugars  
â€”Â surprising how often they're included!  
âœ…Mindset Shift: Sweets aren't rewards; they're old habits I leave behind  
âœ…Natural Sweets: I opt for whole fruits and hydrate with water, steering clear of processed alternatives  
  
What I gain:  
â†’ Mindful eating: Empowered food choices  
â†’ Boosted well-being: Steady energy, better health  
â†’ Time saved: Less label-reading, more focus on what nourishes  
  
It's not about restriction, but active choices for lasting health.

Absorb what is useful, discard what is useless, and add what is specifically your own (Bruce Lee)

Detaching from added sugar is really tough and I need to make a conscious effort to detach. Now I'm again mainly free from added sugar for 125 days. And it feels great. 

It is my choice! And I'm in control. But I also need to take a conscious decision and have to regulate the craving.

Therefore:
+ I don't buy nutrition that has added sugar. I read through the ingredient list of what I purchase. Often one would not even imaging that industry would have added sugar!
+ I reframe my thoughts from sweets being a reward to sweets being a useless, poisoning source
+ I mainly drink water and reject juice, soft-drinks, alcohol and I'm careful with any hidden sugar
+ I eat fruits as whole fruits - e.g. an apple instead of an apples leftover after destroying its structure - like juice or apple puree. And overall reduce fruits intake.
+ I sleep enough - to avoid graving for sugar 
+ I forgive myself if I had a weak moment where I again got trapped. I get back to habit forming and stick to my 2 days rule. There are sometimes just moments where it is not appropriate to reject.

What I gain:
+ My longevity and an exceptional health since several years in a row
+ More consciousness about nutrition
+ Higher and longer lasting energy compared to short term energy bursts and crashing down on energy levels afterwards
+ Interestingly - saving time - as I can discard a huge percentage of processed foods and trim down to my selected sources of nutrition.
