# Fractal reading
[Source Michael Simmons](https://blockbuster.thoughtleader.school/p/augmented-reading-learn-10x-faster-and-better?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)


Before spending hours of reading a non-fiction book, it is worth investing in getting a high level overview to decide on the crucial aspects to explore

## Steps to consider
- look at the books Metadata
	- high signal-to-noise ratio
	- condensed version
- should I read it or not
- which chapters are most important
- "HA" Hack ... **Highlight**, then **Ask** yourself
	- how can I apply that to my life and why is that really important to me

Do deep reading on the crucial part.
- take detailed notes

So - zoom out on crucial items
- Google and Blinkist
- Look for author presentations (e.g. TED talks)
- Scan amazon reviews (this might be automated)
- Read TOC and first/last chapters in Google Books
