# [[From Bowling and Learning]]
## LinkedIn Post
[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_i-hit-a-2x-strike-in-bowling-expert-vs-activity-7236251681678594048-2W-9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
I hit a 2x Strike in bowling. Expert vs. Noop 

â†’ This was only my third time playing
â†’ With most attempts, I whiff completely

For those like me, who are new to bowling:

â†’ The video might look like expert level 
â†’ But advanced players might think,  "Dude, you'll break your hips with those movements." 

And I can tell you, two days later, I have muscle aches in places I didn't know had muscles. 

In my mind, I hit this perfect strike, again and again:

â†’ My whole body is still in the new experience
â†’ I sense an impulse to perfect the movement
â†’ These small successes drive willpower 
â†’ So do the countless failed attempts

A strike in bowling is like a breakthrough in learning:

It looks effortless, but I tried countless times.

â†’ Each failure is a lesson
â†’ Each small success a motivator 
â†’ Continuous adaptation pays off in more success

So, when you see someone hitting a strike, remember:

â†’ It's not just about that moment 
â†’ It's the journey, persistence and learning
âž  That's how you stay ahead

What is ONE advice you would give me to better my strike count?
