From Crisis to Curiosity: My Learning Journey  
  
When I was 18, my world shifted overnight.  
  
My father passed away causing a financial crisis that threatened everything we had built. Suddenly, I went from being a handball team captain worried about games and grades to carrying the weight of adult responsibility - for myself, my grieving mother, our survival.  
  
That fear switched something fundamental in me.  
Standing still was no longer an option.  
  
But there was my foundation:  
Years of leading my team through wins and losses had taught me persistence. My 1.7 final exam grade proved I could push through complexity with willpower and focus.  
  
Then this crisis amplified everything. When I started Information Science studies - staying local to support my mother - I discovered something powerful:  
  
Willpower + time dedication to wade through difficult topics was a genuine competitive advantage.  
  
I remember reading computer magazines, understanding nothing at first.  
But I kept reading until the puzzle pieces began connecting. Painful at the beginning, but I learned that in challenging situations, willpower is a super strong source to move forward.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
The Transformation  
â€”â€”â€”  
For decades, I relied on this willpower-based approach. Achieving success, yes, but often with massive time investment and having to relearn material repeatedly.  
  
Then five years ago, everything changed when I discovered sophisticated learning methodologies and AI enhancement.  
A lot changed... I'm now deeply into better learning and faster action, working with advanced insights.  
  
Since AI emerged, I tap so much more into my curiosity - and I'm actually much happier: I discovered my link between curiosity and happiness.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
The Breakthrough Insight  
â€”â€”â€”  
When you combine willpower and persistence with advanced approaches like AI enhancement, externalizing knowledge, and building compounding systems, you become unstoppable.  
  
My core insight I'dÂ like to share:  
Willpower + AI/Second Brain, propelled by experience, takes you to a whole new level.  
  
â€”â€”â€” Speed. Action. Joy. Quality. Complexity handling â€”â€”â€”  
  
Early on, I learned I could master topics - that I had it in my hands.  
Now I can do that 10-100x faster with higher quality.  
  
This is why I'm passionate about helping knowledge workers build their Learning Ecosystems. To escape drowning in information while starving for applicable wisdom, and instead build systems where knowledge compounds exponentially.  
  
I'd love to hear your story too:  
What's one moment that fundamentally shifted how you approach learning?
