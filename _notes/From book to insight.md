Knowledge × Action = Power

I turned 30 years of 4MAT wisdom into an AI assistant that learns with you

I asked myself: How can I make the 4MAT learning cycle tangible?

So Learning Ecosystem builders can leverage it right away:

→ I took the 4MAT training design mastery course with Hanne Houbak
→ I read Bernice McCarthy's books - especially "Teaching Around the 4MAT Cycle"

I use it to design training sessions and enrich my own learning journey.

Now I want to help others tap into the power of 4MAT.

So I created an AI assistant that becomes your personal 4MAT guide:

1) Read the physical book and captured highlights
2) Used Gemini 2.5 Pro to extract all highlights via a Python script
3) Created a specialized assistant in Langdock with the 4MAT knowledge base
4) Shared with all inaugural course participants

Now they can prompt:
———
→ "How does the 4MAT learning cycle help me learn better?"

→ "How can I immediately benefit from 4MAT in my learning approach?"

→ "Suggest ideas for a full learning cycle" - and the assistant interviews you and suggests options for a holistic learning journey.

Passive book insights transformed into a tangible learning guide.
Following my guiding principle: Knowledge × Action = Power

P.S. This post shows two different topics:
→ From books to tangible insights through AI
→ Learning with the 4MAT cycle
