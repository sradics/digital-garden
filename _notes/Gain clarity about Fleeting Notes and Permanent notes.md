# Gain clarity about Fleeting Notes and Permanent notes
Based on (TODO: Insert recent source here) a fleeting note is using for highly temporary notes that one will likely trash later. They should be just pointers for following up information, maybe also ToDo lists, more noise level information. 
Fire and forget would be just fine on this level.

I'm currently mixing Fleeting notes with the concept of notes maturity. 

## Reflection in permanent notes
Permanent notes will form the building blocks/lego bricks for my Second Brain.  They should be on higher quality level. Originally I thought they might be originating from fleeting notes. But then I discovered the concept of literature notes (TODO: Link here).

And it became obvious that there is a transition from literature notes and derived permanent notes. And there is also a transition from fleeting notes to permanent notes and also to literature notes.

Let's consider some examples:
+ When I read a book, Bib or article and want to capture highlights - these are initially literature notes. They stem from various sources like:
	+ books on Kindle
	+ articles in Matter
	+ bibs in Blinkist
	+ pdfs/eBooks from other sources
+ When I want to capture a fast thought that I want to process later, then this should become a fleeting note (best also linked for later usage with my journal)
+ When I *distill* information from a literature note I create *knowledge artefacts* that become permanent notes. In the beginning this permanent note is still in an early stage (see [[Maturity Model for my Obsidian Notes]])
+ Is a book note already a literature note? Yes, when I created the books note  snippet from the Obsidian book note plugin. No when it is just a thought and I did not yet have time to create a note with more details from it.

### Working with note maturity levels
I should for sure apply maturity levels to my permanent notes. (and change my usage of fleeting notes)

This would still enable an iterative refinement for my permanent notes and evolving them. And when building on it, I can build in a trust layer ... like how much I can rely on a note already or where I need more foundational work.

#### Should I also work with maturity levels for my literature notes?
+ Dimensions might have similar names but transition criteria will be different. And maybe it would be even better to have an own naming convention here.

### Storing permanent notes
In Permanent notes folder when they don't have an obvious area to reside in. In an area when they have a strong connect to that area of responsibility.

I need to further monitor if it makes sense to store them in projects too. For now I don't have strong signals that indicate that this will create a problem.

#### Permanent notes in Projects
What should happen when I archive a project? 
I guess I should scan for permanent notes from that project that are worth keeping in areas. 

How should I handle permanent notes that belong to several projects?
+ Check if it makes sense to move them to an areas
+ I should avoid duplicating that knowledge artefact
+ In beginning I can just link/embed notes in the relevant context and closely monitor the need for extraction. 


## Thinking process
+ [[Building a Second Brain - Insights#Working with Intermediate packets| Intermediate pakets]] 
+ I also have a flow from Remarkable to my Obsidian notes. I think I should visualise all paths through CODE
+ Where do I store my permanent notes? Especially within PARA
