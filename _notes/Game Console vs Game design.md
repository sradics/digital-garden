Æ’# [[Game Console vs Game design]]
## LinkedIn Post
[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_are-you-using-your-brains-ps5-or-still-activity-7262721035882442754-dBHD?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

Are you using your brain's PS5, or still stuck on an Commodore 64?

Leveraging powerful learning tools is like game development on modern consoles.

The full potential is there, but weâ€™re not using itâ€”yet.

Modern consoles, like the PS5 offer amazing possibilities. 
But it takes developers years to really unlock that potential. 

They need to understand and optimize for the consoleâ€™s unique architecture.

Learning is similar. 

We have powerful approaches:
â†’ the 4MAT learning cycle for a holistic learning approach

â†’ the Second Brain approach to C.O.D.E information:
to Capture-Organize-Distill-Express

â†’ Memory Palaces for strong memorization

All powerful hardware for our minds.

But just like game developers, we need to 
invest time, intention, and practice 
to fully leverage them. 

We need to understand our own "learning architecture."

But what holds us back from using these methods now?

â†’ We arenâ€™t taught about them in school.
    
â†’ They require a new mindsetâ€”stepping out of whatâ€™s familiar.
    
â†’ No immediate payoffâ€”they take setup time before you see results.
    
I've realized:  It's not just about having powerful tools. 

It's about optimizing, practicing, and learning to 
use them with intention.

Learning tools only become transformative 
if we commit to understanding and using them.

What's ONE advanced learning technique 
you'd like to understand better?
