---
Is everyone touching the value stream actively engaged in operating it correctly and continually improving it to better address your purposes? — location: [265](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=265) ^ref-31813

follow its value stream from the customer’s order back to materials in receiving. — location: [393](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=393) ^ref-24340

---
What are the business issues with this product? Inadequate return on investment? Poor quality? Inability to meet customer ship dates? Inflexibility in the face of volatile markets? If a firm doesn’t know what its business issues are, how is it going to know what to improve? [This, of course, is simply a restatement of the purpose questions I posed in the previous section.]    2. Who is responsible for the value stream for this product? If no one is responsible for anything, and everyone is responsible for everything, how can the firm improve?    3. How are orders from the customer received?    4. Where is the pacemaker process, triggered by these customer orders?    5. How capable, available, adequate, and waste-free are assembly activities?    6. How capable, available, adequate, and waste-free are the fabrication activities feeding assembly? — location: [395](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=395) ^ref-44607

---
How are orders transmitted up the value stream from the pacemaker process?    8. How are materials supplied to the assembly and fabrication processes?    9. How are materials obtained from upstream suppliers?    10. How are employees trained in lean procedures and motivated to apply them? — location: [404](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=404) ^ref-3791

---
knew from long experience that the issues we had found would be present in every other value stream. — location: [410](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=410) ^ref-53799

---
(Another walk would be required, however, to answer the parallel questions of how lean their product and process development and customer support processes were. — location: [411](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=411) ^ref-40106

product design from concept to launch and then into use by the customer.) — location: [412](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=412) ^ref-22753

with no individual assigned responsibility for managing and improving the total flow of value. — location: [421](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=421) ^ref-49575

the “Lean Team”—was making several interventions in the product family’s value stream at isolated points to improve wasteful practices. — location: [422](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=422) ^ref-37621

---
Clearly identify all your value streams, and clearly state the business issues confronting each. For the specific value stream we observed, set a cost-reduction target that will produce an adequate return. — location: [483](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=483) ^ref-52629

---
Appoint a value-stream manager for each product family — location: [485](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=485) ^ref-27740

By “stable” I mean that each process step is capable. That is, it is able to produce a good part or outcome every time it operates. — location: [501](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=501) ^ref-4415

---
And I also mean that each process step is available. By this I mean that the step is able to operate every time it is needed. — location: [502](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=502) ^ref-45972

---
Capability and availability in combination provide what I call basic stability. — location: [503](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=503) ^ref-2510

---
So I’ve been forced to conclude that a lot of us need to focus on creating basic stability before we try to flow and pull. — location: [514](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=514) ^ref-31152

---
Inadequate stability traces to six types of problems: — location: [520](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=520) ^ref-10571

---
1. Downtime, when a process won’t run at all (also termed major breakdowns or major stoppages).    2. Changeover time to convert from one product to the next.    3. Minor stoppages of just a few seconds.    4. Cycle time fluctuation, when a process takes longer than planned.    5. Scrap, meaning some production is lost.    6. Rework, in which parts must be run through the process again, reducing the time available for new parts. — location: [521](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=521) ^ref-23328

---
high utilization (uptime) to overproduce items that are not needed is one of the worst forms of waste. — location: [529](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=529) ^ref-7065

---
Reducing time lost to changeovers by producing bigger batches rather — location: [529](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=529) ^ref-30697

---
setup times is a big mistake as well. — location: [530](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=530) ^ref-62803

---
practicing breakdown maintenance without identifying trends and determining root causes. — location: [532](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=532) ^ref-12579

---
The challenge is to create a rigorous maintenance process that involves everyone, gathers the appropriate data, discovers the root causes, and installs fixes so known problems don’t recur, and new problems are anticipated — location: [535](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=535) ^ref-28790

---
The biggest problem is that most managers still don’t appreciate the need to get every step in every process precisely specified and conducted correctly every time. — location: [552](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=552) ^ref-3385

---
Simplify every process to minimize your need for information management. — location: [591](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=591) ^ref-16570

---
Compressing your value streams by relocating sequential process steps — location: [593](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=593) ^ref-8732

---
Make every step in your processes capable and available. — location: [595](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=595) ^ref-51680

---
Instead of automating this task, try to eliminate the need for it. — location: [596](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=596) ^ref-55086

---
Even worse, the existence of the safety net removes the pressure to make your process capable. — location: [599](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=599) ^ref-53758

---
When the downstream process uses material, an automatic order is placed to replenish the same — location: [604](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=604) ^ref-61662

---
What managers really need to know is what to do in the next 15 minutes based on what happened in the last 15 minutes. Piling up information in a large inventory is as bad—maybe worse—than piling up large inventories of products. — location: [607](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=607) ^ref-1388

---
Make your information management transparent and intuitive. — location: [610](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=610) ^ref-49402

Simple information management methods like kanban cards and web-based electronic kanban, plus simple heijunka algorithms, — location: [611](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=611) ^ref-38826

---
in the sense that each step in the process simply signaled its immediate need to the next upstream step in the process. — location: [639](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=639) ^ref-35307

---
Or do you let your reflexes pull your finger away without bothering your brain? — location: [643](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=643) ^ref-9705

---
People must be engaged in understanding and improving the processes that create the value desired by the customer if organizational and customer purposes are to be achieved. — location: [671](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=671) ^ref-48868

---
And we often react badly—that is, we become negatively engaged—when we encounter defective processes with no apparent means to improve them. — location: [674](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=674) ^ref-29852

---
rather than step back and think about the process itself and how it could be improved. — location: [696](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=696) ^ref-6272

---
If bad processes create bad employees (and crazy customers, too), it turns out that a bad process for process improvement can create more fault-finding and bad employees of a different sort. — location: [703](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=703) ^ref-37298

---
“How do the team’s requests feel to the individuals or departments being asked to do something different?” — location: [718](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=718) ^ref-23175

---
I asked if the IT department and the experienced employees would be better off with the changed process. And the answer, after a bit of discussion, was clearly “no.” — location: [729](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=729) ^ref-33841

---
were reacting quite rationally to protect their interests because they would be hurt by the changes. — location: [734](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=734) ^ref-53687

---
Instead the problem was a lack of discussion and negotiation between the heads of IT, HR, and the improvement teams about how winners could compensate losers to make everyone whole. — location: [734](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=734) ^ref-22289

---
Understanding how change affects every participant in a value stream takes an extra effort, and I often find that improvement teams shudder at the prospect of negotiations with leaders of all affected parts of the organization. — location: [742](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FRSJ2VS&location=742) ^ref-54969
