Gemini 2.5 Pro really impressed me, especially with its deep research capabilities.

<%* const newFolder = 'S01 Personal/030-039 Areas/Permanent notes/' -%>
<%* function log(msg) { console.log(msg); } -%>
<%* const userFileName = await tp.system.prompt("Filename:") -%>
<%* 
var newName = newFolder +userFileName+'.md'

if (await tp.file.exists(newName)===true) {	
	newName = userFileName+'_'+tp.file.creation_date('YYYY_MM_DD_HH_mm_ss') 
} else {
    newName = userFileName
}
-%>
<%* tR += await tp.file.rename(newName) -%>
<%* await tp.file.move(newFolder+newName) -%>

# <% newName %>

<% await tp.system.clipboard() -%>
<% await tp.file.cursor() -%>

That one request opened up so many new directions for exploration.

Gemini also created three descriptions of the Learning Ecosystem. I chose this one:

â€”â€”â€”
The Learning Ecosystem is your intentionally designed environment for thought. This AI-powered tool helps you build upon your existing knowledge and connect new ideas, transforming scattered information into compounding wisdom through the C.O.D.E. frameworkâ€”ultimately making you not just a better learner, but a more potent thinker and creator.
â€”â€”â€”

The components work like this: 

â†’ Organize your information digitally (but in a way that makes sense for how you think) 
â†’ Turns raw inputs into knowledge you can actually use 
â†’ Let AI assist where it adds value to your process 
â†’ Connect ideas across different domains 
â†’ Adapt everything to work with your unique learning style

Does that resonate?

Iâ€™m still figuring out how it all fits together, but the main thing Iâ€™ve learned is that designing your own learning environment really boosts your thinking.

P.S. Gemini also generated the infographic to go along with the research

P.P.S I'm impressed
