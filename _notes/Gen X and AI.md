You've been driving for 25+ years.  
  
You know every shortcut, read traffic like a book, and can navigate anywhere without breaking a sweat.  
  
Now everyone's talking about these "smart cars" with AI assistants.  
  
Here's your dilemma:  
â€”â€”â€”  
You've spent decades building real skills. Learning systems that actually work. Developing judgment you can trust.  
  
Part of you wonders: "Should I invest time learning this AI thing, or is it just another tech hype that'll waste my time and fail to deliver?"  

But here's the real gut punch:  
â€”â€”â€”  
You're starting to realize that many of the capabilities you worked so hard to develop can now be delegated to these "car assistants."  
  
So what does that leave you with?  
Are you just supposed to become a passenger in your own career?  
  
Here's what most people miss:  
â€”â€”â€”  
The experienced driver doesn't become obsolete when smart cars arrive.  
  
They become the strategic navigator.  
  
While others are still figuring out how to turn on the GPS, you're planning the entire journey. You know which routes to avoid, when to take detours, and how to read the terrain ahead.  
  
AI handles the mechanical driving. You handle the wisdom.  
  
Your next level isn't about competing with AI - it's about conducting it.  
  
But how do you actually make this shift?  
  
Here's what I've been experimenting with to amplify your wisdom with AI:  
  
Step 1: Mine your gold  
â€”â€”â€”  
Pick one big challenge you've solved in your career.  
Write down what happened, what you tried, what failed, what worked.  
  
What did you learn that no textbook could have taught you?  
  
My example: I spent years studying "Theory of Constraints" - read "The Goal," "The Phoenix Project," worked on Kanban implementations. Plus the real learnings from being in messy, real-world situations.  
  
Step 2: Teach AI Your Playbook  
â€”â€”â€”  
Take what you wrote and feed it to ChatGPT or Claude.  
Ask: "What patterns do you see here? What principles could apply to other situations?"  
  
My example: I created "Dr. Throughput" - an AI assistant loaded with my Theory of Constraints knowledge base. Now it helps me optimize workflows using MY hard-won insights.  
  
Step 3: Build Your Wisdom Loop  
â€”â€”â€”  
New challenges feed back into your knowledge base.  
Consult your AI wisdom partner first.  
  
My example: For workflows, I work with Dr. Throughput. I give context, and it spots improvements using TOC principles - filtered through my real-world experience.  

Your experience isn't outdated.Â It's your competitive advantage!  
AI just helps you leverage it faster.  
  
What's one skill you've mastered that you wish you could apply more efficiently? Drop it in the comments - sometimes just naming it is the first step
