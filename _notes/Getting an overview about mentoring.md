# Getting an overview about mentoring
[Source](https://www.pushfar.com/org/resources/pushfar-videos/mentoring-others/9/)

> [!abstract] Definition Mentoring
> The act of one individual sharing their knowledge, skills and/or experience with others, to help them to develop and grow

## Why to mentor
+ Rewarding and Empowering
+ Grow and Learn
+ Challenge yourself 
+ Improve interpersonal skills
+ Wider understanding of industries, organisations and departements

## Introduction meeting
To set expectations.
Recommendation for 1h timeframe.

+ How often to meet
+ What is my experience the mentee can pick up
+ How can I help
+ What is the mentee seeking - Key and big goals the mentee might have

## Tips for effective mentoring
+ Treat each mentoring relationship in a unique way tailored to the mentee
+ Share experience but do not dictate actions
+ And also don't take control of their action or them. Instead help the mentee to navigate their own challenges.
+ Be an active listener
+ Raise concerns and provide clear boundaries for areas I can support as mentor and what is outside of that boundary


## My role as a mentor
+ Offer advice and support, playing off your existing experience and skills.
+ Make it clear to the mentee if I don't have experience in the area the mentee is looking for help
+ Be respectful and maintain confidentiality.
+ Support the mentees best way for development (and not insist on my how I have done something in the past)

## Red flags - What to watch out for
+ I'm not a counsellor or manager. So raise when a conversations shifts too far in that direction.
+ Manage realistic expectations
+ When engagement is draining, check for either changing frequency or bringing the mentoring to an end

## How to end
+ Align on endurance in the beginning
+ Make the call when you think that it is time to end the mentoring meetings

In a final session:
+ Check in of goals & objectives
+ Reflect on developments
+ Request for feedback

## Reflection and Takeways
Reflect on:
+ improved interpersonal skills
+ improved understanding of different roles 
+ and how I might transfer that to other industries and situations
+ learn from face challenges and conflicts
