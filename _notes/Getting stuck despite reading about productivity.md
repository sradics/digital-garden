Getting stuck despite reading about productivity?  
â†’ Two tiny tools that actually move the needle  
  
Everyone consumes productivity content. Few people see real progress.  
The gap isn't knowledge ... it's implementation.  
  
Here's what I've learned works:  
  
â†’ Tool 1: Work with a PACT to get into progress.  
(Credits to Tiny Experiments by [Anne-Laure Le Cunff, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neuranne/))  
  
â†’ Tool 2: The Idea Explorer  
Takes any idea and shows you 17 different angles to extend it.  
(Credits to [Michael Simmons](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeldsimmons/))  
  
The problem with most productivity advice?  
It stays theoretical. That's why I built something different.  
  
A Productivity Suite that makes these tools accessible to everyone:

â†’ Free tokens to experiment with  
â†’ Free access to both AI assistants  
â†’ More productivity assistants coming soon  
  
Ready to move from reading to doing?  
Check out the Productivity Suite and let me know how it works for you.  

See you in the weeds.
