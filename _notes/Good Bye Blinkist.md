4.75 years with one of the best employers.  
  
‚Üí Let go, and still in Love: My Last Day‚Äôs Thoughts  
  
I never imagined finding my purpose when I joined [Blinkist](https://www.linkedin.com/company/blinkist/) in 2019.  
  
I joined shortly before the global lockdown period.  
It started on a high, but soon came a challenge.  
  
The Commute disappeared. Change forced.  
The main usage scenario gone.  
  
A journey through rapid innovation continued.  
  
I started as an Agile Coach.  
Worked with smart product development teams.  
  
We developed innovative formats.  
I transitioned and supported through various roles.  
  
‚Üí ShortCasts > key insights from PodCasts  
I was the Agile Coach  
  
‚Üí Blinkist Guides > key insights on topics, presented by a guide  
I was the Product Discovery Coach  
  
‚Üí Blinkist Coaching > Leadership soft skill training using key insights  
I was the Course and Workshop Designer  
  
All connected with the topic of Learning.  
It became my passion to Learn how to Learn.  
  
Dear Blinkist - I'm grateful for  
  
‚á¢ your founder spirit [Holger Seim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/holgerseim/), Tobias, [Niklas Jansen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/niklasjansen/), Sebastian
