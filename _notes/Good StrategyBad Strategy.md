a strategy is a coherent set of analyses, concepts, policies, arguments, and actions that respond to a high-stakes challenge. — location: [266](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005331U7Q&location=266) ^ref-47313

---
A good strategy includes a set of coherent actions. They are not “implementation” details; they are the punch in the strategy. A strategy that fails to define a variety of plausible and feasible immediate actions is missing a critical component. — location: [271](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005331U7Q&location=271) ^ref-39625

action. — location: [283](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005331U7Q&location=283) ^ref-17326

The guiding policy specifies the approach to dealing with the obstacles called out in the diagnosis. — location: [283](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005331U7Q&location=283) ^ref-37439

---
Coherent actions are feasible coordinated policies, resource commitments, and actions designed to carry out the guiding policy. — location: [284](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005331U7Q&location=284) ^ref-4840

The most basic idea of strategy is the application of strength against weakness. — location: [301](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005331U7Q&location=301) ^ref-59113

strength applied to the most promising opportunity. — location: [301](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005331U7Q&location=301) ^ref-53227

natural advantage of good strategy arises because other organizations often don’t have one. — location: [321](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005331U7Q&location=321) ^ref-38944

A good strategy has coherence, coordinating actions, policies, and resources so as to accomplish an important end. — location: [322](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005331U7Q&location=322) ^ref-22585

The power of Jobs’s strategy came from directly tackling the fundamental problem with a focused and coordinated set of actions. — location: [350](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005331U7Q&location=350) ^ref-30496

Most complex organizations spread rather than concentrate resources, acting to placate and pay off internal and external interests. — location: [455](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005331U7Q&location=455) ^ref-53966

Having conflicting goals, dedicating resources to unconnected targets, and accommodating incompatible interests are the luxuries of the rich and powerful, but they make for bad strategy. — location: [468](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005331U7Q&location=468) ^ref-58326

Failure to face the challenge. Bad strategy fails to recognize or define the challenge. When you cannot define the challenge, you cannot evaluate a strategy or improve it. — location: [649](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005331U7Q&location=649) ^ref-53184
