# [[Good bye Berlin, Welcome Halberstadt]]

## LinkedIn Post

[Post at LinkedIn]()

![[Pasted image 20241118031220.png]]

10 years, 4 companies, 1 city  
  
â†’ My Berlin chapter closes today  
  
After 10 years in Berlin, itâ€™s time for a new chapterâ€”today,  
Iâ€™m relocating to Halberstadt.  
  
For me a moment to pause, look back, and express deep gratitude for the growth and learning opportunities Iâ€™ve had during these 10 years.  

Thank you, [idealo internet GmbH](https://www.linkedin.com/company/idealo-internet-gmbh/), for providing the perfect environment to:  
  
â†’ Lead an incredible Agile team  
â†’ Collaborate with passionate people  
â†’ Shape a significant business unit transformation  

Thank you, Solarisbank, for the opportunity to:  
  
â†’ Grow a fantastic Agile team  
â†’ Work on a company-wide level to  
help teams flourish and deliver impactful results  

Thank you, [Blinkist](https://www.linkedin.com/company/blinkist/), for letting me explore diverse roles:  
  
â†’ As an Agile Coach supporting teams across the company  
â†’ As a Product Coach driving exciting product initiatives  
â†’ As a Course Designer and Workshop Facilitator  
  
I had the honour to work with so many awesome people.  
To Grow deep friendships.  
You helped me with major breakthroughs:  
  
âž  Becoming a Systemic Coach  
âž  (Re-)Discover my joy in learning  
  
In my personal life, it has been nothing short of a rollercoaster:  
  
â†’ Living through a divorce, which was deeply challenging.  
â†’ I found my great Second Bloomer love and got married again â€”  
A dream I never thought possible.  
  
Quite an intense decade.  
  
Now, Iâ€™m looking forward to building our dream life in the much smaller, quieter town Halberstadt.  
  
Remote work makes this possible, and Iâ€™m incredibly thankful for this opportunity to combine professional growth with a lifestyle that feels right.  
  
To all the amazing companions of this Berlin chapter:  
  
Thank you for the unforgettable moments, your unwavering support, the shared fun, and the drive we created together.  
  
Hereâ€™s to what lies ahead!  

â€”â€”â€”  
P.S.  
While I publish this post I'm already on the road.  
I'll answer to all your comments a little later.
