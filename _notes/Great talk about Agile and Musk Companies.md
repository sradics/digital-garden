# Great talk about Agile and Musk Companies

Great talk on Agile … How would Elon Musk run your business: [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9koMbfO6_s)  - full credits to [AgeOfProduct](https://age-of-product.com/) and [Joe Justice](https://www.youtube.com/c/JoeJustice0/videos)

+ drive to align the board
+ know your big goal (1000 year goal)
+ derive strong KPIs that really enable to see progress in direction of the big goal - crowdsource KPI ownership
+ establish digital self management - teams can see their contribution immediately, by themselfes (not waiting for someone in the middle to update). Enable smart and autonomous decisions, e.g. where to contribute best (so fluid orga and project contributions).   … everyone gets the same data in real time (no information hierarchy)
	+ group work based on the goal to drive a special part of the KPI
	+ 1/2 of the 150k people work on driving automation! (so 75k people)
* MOB around a topic - group work
* profit means more money for research. No dividents to investors.
* pace of the innovation is the only thing that matters in the long run
* teams - self empowered and self organizing measured their own performance by the money they spent to improve the KPI
