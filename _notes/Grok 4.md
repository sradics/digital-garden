Everyone's debating "Will we get AGI?"  
  
â†’ Meanwhile, they're building ASI.  
  
Yesterday's Grok 4 presentation wasn't just another AI demo.  
It was a glimpse into what's already happening.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
9 quotes that caught my attention:  
"This is the smartest AI in the world and we're going to show you exactly how and why."  
"Grok 4 is smarter than almost all graduate students in all disciplines simultaneously... it's actually just important to appreciate that's really something."  
"With respect to academic questions, Grok is better than PhD level in every subject, no exceptions."  
"I think it may discover new technologies as soon as later this year. And I would be shocked if it has not done so next year... it might discover new physics next year and within two years I'd say almost certainly."  
"We're in the intelligence big bang right now. We're at the most interesting time to be alive of any time in history."  
"We will effectively have an economy that is thousands of times bigger than our current economy or maybe millions of times."  
"The actual notion of a human economy assuming civilization continues to progress will seem very quaint... it will seem like cavemen throwing sticks into a fire level of economy compared to what the future will hold."  
"The ultimate test I think for whether an AI is... the ultimate reasoning test is reality... because physics is the law ultimately everything else is a recommendation. You can't break physics."  
"We expect to be training our video model with over 100,000 GB200s and to begin that training within the next 3 or 4 weeks."

Closing question: Are we discussing the right questions at the moment?

P.S. On comparably lower scale,  
but see it as an entry point to your own exploration:  
Learning Ecosystem Mastery Cohort#02 starts on July 23rd  
  
Early Bird only until this Sunday
