Skip the one-size-fits-all that bores half your room

â†’ How I'm engaging all 4 learning styles

Just wrapping up week two where everyone took their 4MAT learning style tests. Pretty cool to see the results!

Our group's learning style mix is interesting:

â†’ Most gravitate toward "What" thinking (the analysts who love structure and expert knowledge)

â†’ Fewest are "How" folks (the hands-on implementers)

This mix makes our discussions richer but means I need to design sessions that work for different styles.

Here's how I'm handling this so far:
â€”â€”â€”
â†’ For the "Why" thinkers: 
Discussion time in live sessions and our Circle community for deeper questions

â†’ For the "What" crowd: 
Sharing all materials they can dig into independently

â†’ For the "How" doers: 
Hands-on work with Obsidian and AI assistants during sessions

â†’ For the "What If" innovators: 
Working on creating more space for experimentation. Ideas?

Already seeing how the 4MAT approach energizes our sessions. Excited for what's next!

What's your learning style? 
Does it affect how you work?
