# Growing AI productivity stack

## Fast summarization of videos (and texts)

### Extract text from video

+ [http://youtubetranscript.com](http://youtubetranscript.com/)Â helps to get a transcript for a youtube video
+ In [Panopto](panopto.com) one can mark the captions and copy them all at once

### Summarize with Lex

[Lex](https://lex.page/) can summarize provided text super fast. I just create a new document with the text from the transcript an the prompt with: Summarize.

Based on that summary I can drill down on topics that might be interesting. 
Example: [[Learning about Focus Drivers Approach - Park, Off Road, Sports, and Eco mode]]  was completely done this way, based on a 90' minute video that I even did not have to watch.

## Creating images 

The chain of ChatGPT 4 combined with [MidJourney](https://www.midjourney.com/app/) is just awesome.
My current approach:
+ Use ChatGPT 4 prompt to get inspiration for an image e.g. for the concept of freedom. Prompt: *Which images would express freedom*
+ Ask for creating a Midjourney prompt: *Create a prompt for the Flying Birds that I can use for MidJourney image generating AI*
+ Use that in MidJourney as prompt behind *imagine*

Example application: [[Working on my Ikigai]] and [[Find your Ikigai]].

## Apply AI on Obsidian Second Brain

Using the [Smart Connection Obsidian plugin](https://github.com/brianpetro/obsidian-smart-connections), I can work with AI approaches directly on my notes within my Second Brain. This is really supporting reflection and serendipity for notes.
