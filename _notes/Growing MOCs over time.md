The Agile coach's dilemma: 16 years of knowledge

â†’ But where is it when you need it?

I recently had the pleasure of designing and running an Agile 101 cohort.
Thanks to Blinkist for having me a the course facilitator. 

Drawing on my extensive experience as an Agile Coach since 2008 â€”spanning 16 years across five different companies and dozens of teams, including leadership roles â€” 

I faced a familiar challenge to convert my experiences into a cohesive course.

It took my ages to find various artefacts. 

My materials were scattered everywhere: on Google Drive, my computer, paper notes, and even just in my head.

But this time, things were different.

When designing my session on Agile Teams, 
I turned to my Map of Contents about Teams:
â†’ I found many insightful resources
â†’ already connected and distilled
â†’ enriched with my thoughts

This is knowledge Iâ€™ve gathered over many yearsâ€”my knowledgeâ€”accessible in minutes.

Compare that to searching through several books, courses, memory, or ten different paper notebooks.

With my knowledge captured, organized, and distilled, I could focus on designing a great course.

I was able to focus on designing a great course. 

And the results speak for themselves:
â†’ Participants loved it, with a 91% rating across two cohorts.
â†’ Creating the sessions was a joy.
â†’ I felt confident running it.

This is the power of personal knowledge management.

I achieve this by following the Second Brain approach from Tiago Forte, combined with Notemaking Mastery elements from Nick Milo, building on the wisdom of experts I admire.

Can you recall a moment when having your knowledge at hand immediately would have been beneficial?
