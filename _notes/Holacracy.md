## Highlights
Even though it was a minority voice, it was one I really needed to listen to at that moment. Dismissing its wisdom just because my other instruments didn’t see any trouble was a shortsighted decision that could have cost me my life. — location: [74](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=74) ^ref-18480

---
Too often, an organization’s “sensor” has critical information that is ignored and therefore goes unprocessed. One individual notices something important, but no one else sees it and no channels are available to process that insight into meaningful change. In this way, we often outvote the low-voltage lights of our organizations. — location: [80](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=80) ^ref-51333

---
Yet, on most teams, critical perspectives that aren’t shared by the leader or by the majority are often ignored or dismissed. — location: [85](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=85) ^ref-25789

---
The human capacity to sense dissonance in the present moment and see the potential for change strikes me as one of our most extraordinary gifts—our restless, never-satisfied, creative spirit that keeps us always reaching beyond where we are. — location: [94](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=94) ^ref-39575

Evolution is an algorithm; it is an all-purpose formula for innovation … that, through its special brand of trial and error, creates new designs and solves difficult problems.” — location: [114](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=114) ^ref-35783

How can we reshape a company into an evolutionary organism—one that can sense and adapt and learn and integrate? — location: [120](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=120) ^ref-34065

---
When those tensions can be processed quickly and effectively, at least to the extent that they relate to the organization’s work, then the organization can benefit from an enhanced capacity to dynamically and continually evolve. — location: [125](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=125) ^ref-24055

---
the predict-and-control approach focuses on designing the “perfect” system up front to prevent tensions (and then on reorganizing once those at the top realize they didn’t quite get it right). This — location: [131](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=131) ^ref-50212

In today’s postindustrial world, however, organizations face significant new challenges: increasing complexity, enhanced transparency, greater interconnection, shorter time horizons, economic and environmental instability, and demands to have a more positive impact on the world. — location: [135](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=135) ^ref-11390

“The world is becoming more turbulent than organizations are becoming adaptable. Organizations were not built for these kinds of changes.” — location: [141](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=141) ^ref-50225

Now I could really process whatever it was I sensed, right? Well, there was still a higher boss to act as a bottleneck, and another, and another. — location: [146](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=146) ^ref-21013

---
techniques, I routinely see a huge obstacle to their deployment: when they’re applied in an organizational system that’s still conventionally structured, there’s a major paradigm clash. — location: [164](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=164) ^ref-57782

---
A great new meeting technique helps empower a team, for instance, but those team members are still constrained by a power structure at play outside of the meeting and throughout the rest of the company. — location: [167](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=167) ^ref-47279

---
to really transform an organization, we must move beyond bolting on changes and instead focus on upgrading the most foundational aspects of the way the organization functions. — location: [173](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=173) ^ref-17395

---
Likewise, the operating system underpinning an organization is easy to ignore, yet it’s the foundation on which we build our business processes (the “apps” of organization), and it shapes the human culture as well. — location: [186](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=186) ^ref-44877

---
Essentially, it’s a new social technology for governing and operating an organization, defined by a set of core rules distinctly different from those of a conventionally governed organization. Holacracy includes the following elements: — location: [196](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=196) ^ref-36693

---
a constitution, which sets out the “rules of the game” and redistributes authority • a new way to structure an organization and define people’s roles and spheres of authority within it • a unique decision-making process for updating those roles and authorities • a meeting process for keeping teams in sync and getting work done together — location: [198](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=198) ^ref-20137

---
This is where Holacracy really comes alive—in the day-to-day work of processing tensions into meaningful change, for the sake of whatever purpose the organization is here to express. — location: [218](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=218) ^ref-8866

“Research shows that every time the size of a city doubles, innovation or productivity per resident increases by 15 percent. But when companies get bigger, innovation or productivity per employee generally goes down.” — location: [226](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=226) ^ref-51570

---
If the residents of our cities had to wait for authorization from the boss for every decision they made, the city would quickly grind to a halt. — location: [244](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=244) ^ref-55773

how do you enable an organization to effectively self-organize? — location: [248](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=248) ^ref-65486

There’s a predominant view today that improving organizations means getting highly developed, wise, conscious leaders in power to serve as “good parents.” — location: [260](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=260) ^ref-36369

---
others in the role of victims. No matter how much today’s best leaders may want to empower others and give them a voice, the formal power structure in most modern corporations is that of a dictatorship. — location: [267](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=267) ^ref-40279

---
This ultimate reliance on the CEO or equivalent limits the capacity to harness all tensions sensed throughout an organization, and creates a potential single point of failure in the organization’s capacity to effectively govern itself. — location: [272](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=272) ^ref-32089

no explicit power structure is in place, an implicit structure will emerge. — location: [289](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=289) ^ref-40755

---
There is a big difference, I discovered, between having a voice and being able to do something with your voice—being able to actually process what you sense into meaningful change. — location: [295](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=295) ^ref-63648

---
Consensus didn’t accomplish that. In fact, all it resulted in was long painful meetings where we would try to force everyone to see things the same way. That isn’t helpful or healthy, and it only gets worse as an organization grows. — location: [297](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=297) ^ref-43419

---
the result is often a watered-down group decision that becomes very difficult to change, saddling would-be innovators with less-than-ideal entrenched structures to navigate. — location: [301](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=301) ^ref-59933

---
need to be given the power to respond to issues “locally,” within their domain or work, without having to get everyone else’s buy-in or rely on an empowering leader for permission. — location: [305](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=305) ^ref-61054

---
when the core authority structure and processes of an organization fundamentally hold space for everyone to have and use power, and do not allow anyone—even a leader—to co-opt the power of others, then we no longer need to rely on leaders who empower others. — location: [310](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=310) ^ref-3534

---
a space where we can all find our own empowerment, and a system that protects that space regardless of the actions of any one individual, whatever his or her position. — location: [312](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=312) ^ref-58181

Holacracy constitution acts as the core rulebook for the organization. — location: [317](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=317) ^ref-61370

This shift from personal leadership to constitutionally derived power is essential to Holacracy’s new paradigm. — location: [327](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=327) ^ref-60731

following orders. They have real power and authority—and with those comes responsibility. — location: [336](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=336) ^ref-23977

---
yet that’s not his experience at all. He’s found that many seasoned CEOs like the idea of releasing their personally held power into an organizational process, if they can find a safe way to do so that more effectively meets the organization’s needs. — location: [343](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=343) ^ref-51950

enough input to confidently make a decision, he or she can comfortably cut off the dialogue, thank those involved, and make that decision. — location: [370](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=370) ^ref-58221

---
There’s a technical term for the process by which we assign power or authority in an organization: “governance.” — location: [379](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=379) ^ref-16813

---
And when attention is given, the context is often a big reorganization that creates as many problems as it resolves and that ends up detached from the real needs of getting work done. — location: [382](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=382) ^ref-14896

---
Operations is about getting work done— — location: [393](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=393) ^ref-39996

---
Governance is about how we work—the pattern of how we organize, — location: [394](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=394) ^ref-50468

---
Governance is about the structure of the organization’s work, and the authorities and expectations that go along with it. Both governance and operations may be informed by a relevant strategy, meaning a guiding theme or rule of thumb to apply as a team navigates in its journey to express the organization’s purpose. — location: [396](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=396) ^ref-12792

---
The governance question, however, would be “What role has the authority to make that decision, within what constraints, and what can we expect from that role as a condition of its having this authority?” — location: [400](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=400) ^ref-62028

---
most organizations have little in the way of an explicit governance process or of the clarity that such a process produces; what governance does exist is often irrelevant and ignored (for instance, the typical “job description”), with no clear process for dynamically updating it. — location: [406](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=406) ^ref-44400

---
What are the ongoing activities we need to pay attention to, and who will own each? What expectations can I reasonably hold of others, and vice versa? Who will make which decisions, and within what limits? What decisions can I make and what actions can I take without having to call a meeting? What policies or constraints will we honor in our work together? How can we change the answers to these questions as we learn better ways of working together? — location: [409](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=409) ^ref-47002

---
All too often, this inability to engage leaves workers vulnerable and disconnected, with no healthy or useful outlet for improving the status quo. — location: [432](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=432) ^ref-52419

The E-Myth, points out that one of the biggest mistakes entrepreneurs tend to make is that they get stuck working in their businesses rather than working on their businesses. — location: [446](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=446) ^ref-17162

When parents let go of their own personal dreams for their children, they create space to find out what those children were really born to do—what creative impulse is waiting to express itself through each child.

---
“I want my company to do X,” we can find the organization’s own creative impulse—the deepest potential or creative capacity it can sustainably express in the world, given everything available to it. — location: [474](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=474) ^ref-53300

“formal structure”—the org chart and the job descriptions. — location: [504](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=504) ^ref-2286

---
The formal structure in most organizations is far removed from real day-to-day events and needs, so that job descriptions are little more than formalized bureaucratic artifacts. — location: [508](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=508) ^ref-40305

This is the structure that is actually operating—the often implicit reality of who’s making what decisions or who owns which projects. — location: [512](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=512) ^ref-16630

---
As we work together in this way, cultural norms develop, and we start aligning with them, creating an implicit structure that becomes the unconscious “way things are done.” — location: [514](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=514) ^ref-29230

governance process to clarify that division of labor more effectively. So while we do have a formally captured structure in Holacracy, it is continually being refined and modified in response to tensions sensed by individuals as they go about their daily work, to reflect our best understanding of how we need to organize to most effectively get the work done. — location: [524](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=524) ^ref-27080

---
people do refer to their own and others’ job descriptions regularly, sometimes on a daily basis—because job descriptions contain relevant, accurate, clear, and useful information about what it makes sense to do and expect. — location: [527](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=527) ^ref-34221

Holacracy means governance (-cracy) of and by the organizational holarchy (hola-). — location: [543](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=543) ^ref-31119

Those roles are parts of the company, and are the most basic building block of Holacracy’s structure. — location: [548](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=548) ^ref-38635

Holacracy is all about organizing the work, not the people, — location: [552](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=552) ^ref-55238

A much more useful question is “What are those people counting on you for?” — location: [560](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=560) ^ref-44320

and clarity about these accountabilities is critical to the smooth running of an organization. — location: [562](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=562) ^ref-45458

---
But too often, different people have different ideas about what each of them ought to be owning and doing, and this lack of clarity leads to all sorts of interpersonal friction and politics. — location: [563](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=563) ^ref-13489

---
Do any of these symptoms show up in your organization? If so, you may be suffering from a lack of clarity around roles and accountabilities. • mistrust and frustration between coworkers • critical tasks being “missed” • lots of meetings with much discussion to reach consensus on things • emails flying around with many people cc’d, often for unclear reasons • people check in with everyone before making decisions, and expect that others will too • people have lots of ideas about what “we” should do … but “we” doesn’t do it — location: [569](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=569) ^ref-54993

---
To get to clarity, we must first let go of the idea that others should align with our implicit expectations (or anyone else’s). — location: [580](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=580) ^ref-34576

---
When things get really clear and concrete, it can feel awkward at first. But as clarity grows, trust is often a natural outcome. — location: [587](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=587) ^ref-34471

---
Over time, the organizational culture becomes more and more free of people using politics as a means of influence, simply because generating clarity through governance is more effective. An — location: [588](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=588) ^ref-24447

Instead, we might speak of a task being assigned to “Trainer,” or “Program Design,” or “Finance”—each of which is a role that I fill. — location: [593](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=593) ^ref-63983

For example, often it is hard to separate emotions about people from emotions about the roles they — location: [599](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=599) ^ref-10906

---
Such conflicts become unnecessarily personal, and when we try to resolve them by smoothing over the human relationships, we miss the opportunity to clarify the underlying organizational “role-ationships”—a term I use to mean the relationship between our roles and what those roles need and want of each other, separate from our personal connection. — location: [601](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=601) ^ref-50109

---
The tension arises from a clash of priorities or expectations between these two roles, and the opportunity here is to clarify what it makes sense to expect of each role for the sake of the broader purpose. — location: [608](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=608) ^ref-33719

---
To facilitate clear and concrete role definitions, the Holacracy constitution defines a role as consisting of three specific elements: a “purpose” to express; possibly one or more “domains” to control; and a set of “accountabilities” to enact. — location: [616](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=616) ^ref-64821

This coupling of authority with accountability helps avoid the situation we often see, in which people are held responsible for something they don’t have the authority to actually do. — location: [623](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=623) ^ref-20831

---
Holacracy role definitions are based on the reality of what activities are experienced as useful in the organization, and they stay in sync with that evolving reality. — location: [637](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=637) ^ref-15701

We no longer need meetings at which we discuss every decision, as we know what authority we have and what other roles we may need to involve and why. — location: [646](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=646) ^ref-3949

Roles, in the way I’ve just described them, are like the cells of the organization. — location: [653](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=653) ^ref-44967

In a holarchy, each part or holon is not subjugated to those above it, but retains autonomy, individual authority, and wholeness. — location: [656](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=656) ^ref-17549

A circle is not a group of people but a group of roles, and it is also, in a sense, a really big role itself, — location: [674](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=674) ^ref-58582

---
The roles a circle contains are a breakdown of what’s needed to express its overall purpose, enact its accountabilities, and control its domains. A circle has the autonomy and authority to self-organize and to coordinate and integrate the work of all the roles it contains. — location: [676](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=676) ^ref-38522

The “Lead Link” is appointed by the super-circle to represent its needs in the sub-circle. A lead link holds the perspective and functions needed to align the sub-circle with the purpose, strategy, and needs of its broader context. The other link, called a “Representative Link” or “Rep Link,” is elected by the members of the sub-circle, and represents the sub-circle within its super-circle. — location: [694](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=694) ^ref-64313

A rep link helps make the super-circle a healthy environment for the sub-circle, by carrying key perspectives from the sub-circle to the super-circle’s governance and operations. — location: [697](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=697) ^ref-48847

Holacracy, from the most junior to the most senior person, can own his or her power and authority in alignment with clear accountabilities, and have others respect his or her sovereignty.” — location: [739](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=739) ^ref-51071

A lead link may be able to remove someone from a role, but she has no authority to fire someone, determine compensation, or define new roles and expectations for people outside of the governance process. — location: [741](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=741) ^ref-21397

The answer, under Holacracy’s rules, is a clear no. While a role filler does have a duty to do something to express her accountability, she doesn’t have to accept a specific project as the way to do it. — location: [751](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=751) ^ref-12332

“second” link, but a different function from the lead link altogether. If the lead link is mostly a membrane around the cell, the rep link is a direct channel from within the core of the cell out through that membrane. — location: [759](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=759) ^ref-44839

Adding a cross link between two circles provides a direct channel for processing tensions within one circle that were sensed in another circle, — location: [779](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=779) ^ref-19817

However, if two sub-circles have so much integration to do that it would become a distraction for the larger circle, it makes more sense to appoint a cross link from one of those circles into the other, so that they can work out their issues directly without bringing them to the larger circle. — location: [786](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=786) ^ref-58860

To facilitate the processing of tensions in different ways, at least two different types of meetings are held regularly within each circle, and each meeting type has its own process and rules of the game. — location: [810](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=810) ^ref-62501

Governance meetings in mature circles are often held every month or two, but I recommend two meetings per month for most new circles and for those with many members who are new to Holacracy. — location: [815](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=815) ^ref-28727

“There is no freedom without discipline, no vision without a form.… If there were no lines painted on the road, you wouldn’t be free to let your mind wander and be creative while you drive. You’d be too busy hoping no one hits you. But if there were too many lanes and restrictions and rules, you’d have traffic moving much slower than it should, as everyone was trying to pay attention to the right place to be.” — location: [853](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PF6QM6K&location=853) ^ref-46194
