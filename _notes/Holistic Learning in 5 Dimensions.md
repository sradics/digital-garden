You can take your learning to the next level  
(5 dimensions of holistic learning)  
  
Learning is a journey that requires a well-rounded approach to truly excel.  
You can transform the way you absorb, retain, and apply knowledge.  
  
Lets's explore 5 dimensions of your holistic learning approach:  
———  
1️⃣ Personal Knowledge Management with a Second Brain  
Transform how you handle information with the Second Brain method.  
As David Allen says, “Your brain is for having ideas, not holding them.”  
  
To turn information into innovative thoughts follow this flow:  
→ Capture  
→ Organize  
→ Distill  
→ Express  
  
2️⃣ 4MAT Learning Cycle  
Convert learning into applied knowledge with the 4MAT learning cycle.  
Fully integrate new skills through:  
Connect → Attend → Image → Inform → Practice → Extend → Refine → Perform.  
  
3️⃣ Learning Mindset  
Consistency is key.  
Establish a habit of continuous learning.  
Use principles from Atomic Habits to develop a sustainable learning routine.  
  
4️⃣ Learning about Learning - Metacognition  
Enhance retention, speed, and effectiveness by regularly evaluating your approach.  
  
5️⃣ (Mental) Fitness  
Support your brain with a solid foundation.  
To boost cognitive performance prioritize:  
→ sleep  
→ healthy eating  
→ regular exercise

## Content preparation

I consider 5 main dimensions that contribute to your holistic learning.
1️⃣ Personal Knowledge Management with a Second Brain
For personal knowledge management I recommend the method Second Brain. A Second Brain is build on the claim: Our Brain is for having Ideas and not for storing them (by David Allan). Through a cycle of Capture-Organize-Distille-Express on can transform information to new expressions of thoughts.

2️⃣ 4MAT learning cycle
To ensure that you learn, it is recommended to transform learning input to applied  knowledge. Use a full 4MAT learning cycle where you work through the eight stages Connect-Attend-Image-Inform-Practice-Extend-Refine and Perform.

3️⃣ Learning Mindset
When learning a more complicated topic you need several learning sessions and likely need to work through a lot of material. Learning consistency is key. When you understand how forming a habit of continuous learning works you can develop that consistency. Atomic Habits tailored to forming a learning habit is my approach.

4️⃣ Learning about Learning - Metacognition
Regularly reflecting on your current approach to learning provides lets you continuously improve. Your become faster, retain more and stay on track.

5️⃣ (Mental) Fitness
Investing in your fitness - mentally and physically supports your learning. If you take care to sleep well, eat healthy and regularly exercise you support your brain activity with a solid foundation.
