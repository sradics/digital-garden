change behavior by guiding users through a series of experiences I call hooks. — location: [253](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=253) ^ref-50682

---
The more often users run through these hooks, the more likely they are to form habits. — location: [254](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=254) ^ref-4784

---
Through consecutive Hook cycles, successful products reach their ultimate goal of unprompted user engagement, bringing users back repeatedly, without depending on costly advertising or aggressive messaging. — location: [275](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=275) ^ref-12739

trigger is the actuator of behavior — location: [281](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=281) ^ref-62534

---
Habit-forming products start by alerting users with external triggers like an e-mail, a Web site link, or the app icon on a phone. — location: [283](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=283) ^ref-28982

Hooks connect the user’s problem with a company’s solution frequently enough to form a habit. — location: [354](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=354) ^ref-36693

---
responses in the basal ganglia, an area of the brain associated with involuntary actions.2 Habits form when the brain takes a shortcut and stops actively deliberating over what to do next.3 The brain quickly learns to codify behaviors that provide a solution to whatever situation it encounters. — location: [385](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=385) ^ref-57285

---
The brain automatically deduces that if the decision was a good one yesterday, then it is a safe bet again today and the action becomes a routine. — location: [394](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=394) ^ref-31468

The aim is to influence customers to use your product on their own, again and again, without relying on overt calls to action such as ads or promotions. — location: [400](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=400) ^ref-34039

“many innovations fail because consumers irrationally overvalue the old while companies irrationally overvalue the new.”8 Gourville claims that for new entrants to stand a chance, they can’t just be better, they must be nine times better. — location: [456](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=456) ^ref-46076

---
users also increase their dependency on habit-forming products by storing value in them — location: [470](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=470) ^ref-7426

---
The nontransferable value created and stored inside these services discourages users from leaving. — location: [474](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=474) ^ref-46447

---
The fact is that successfully changing long-term user habits is exceptionally rare. — location: [479](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=479) ^ref-9043

---
For new behaviors to really take hold, they must occur often. — location: [495](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=495) ^ref-33143

---
engagement with a product—especially over a short period of time—increases the likelihood of forming new routines. Google Search provides an example — location: [498](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=498) ^ref-32339

---
For an infrequent action to become a habit, the user must perceive a high degree of utility, either from gaining pleasure or avoiding pain. — location: [513](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=513) ^ref-35043

---
A company can begin to determine its product’s habit-forming potential by plotting two factors: frequency (how often the behavior occurs) and perceived utility (how useful and rewarding the behavior is in the user’s mind over alternative solutions). — location: [532](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=532) ^ref-30270

---
Some behaviors never become habits because they do not occur frequently enough. — location: [541](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=541) ^ref-27343

---
On the other axis, however, even a behavior that provides minimal perceived benefit can become a habit simply because it occurs frequently. — location: [543](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=543) ^ref-53884

---
that some habits can be formed in a matter of weeks while others can take more than five months.21 The researchers also found that the complexity of the behavior and how important — location: [546](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=546) ^ref-22927

---
the habit was to the person greatly affected how quickly the routine was formed. — location: [548](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=548) ^ref-12995

Painkillers solve an obvious need, relieving a specific pain, and often have quantifiable markets. — location: [562](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=562) ^ref-29558

---
A habit is when not doing an action causes a bit of discomfort. — location: [579](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=579) ^ref-30621

---
The habit-forming products we use are simply there to provide some sort of relief. — location: [580](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=580) ^ref-39555

---
Habit-forming technologies are both. These services seem at first to be offering nice-to-have vitamins, but once the habit is established, they provide an ongoing pain remedy. Avoiding pain is a key motivator in all species. When — location: [582](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=582) ^ref-43518

When successful, forming strong user habits can have several business benefits including: higher customer lifetime value (CLTV), greater pricing flexibility, supercharged growth, and a sharper competitive edge. — location: [607](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=607) ^ref-42203

---
Habits cannot form outside the Habit Zone, where the behavior occurs with enough frequency and perceived utility. — location: [609](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=609) ^ref-27781

---
What habits does your business model require? What problem are users turning to your product to solve? How do users currently solve that problem and why does it need a solution? How frequently do you expect users to engage with your product once they are habituated? What user behavior do you want to make into a habit? — location: [617](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=617) ^ref-54429

---
Similarly, new habits need a foundation upon which to build. Triggers provide the basis for sustained behavior change. — location: [644](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=644) ^ref-9450

---
Triggers take the form of obvious cues like the morning alarm clock but also come as more subtle, sometimes subconscious signals that just as effectively influence our daily behavior. — location: [646](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=646) ^ref-36242

---
Habit-forming technologies start changing behavior by first cueing users with a call to action. — location: [650](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=650) ^ref-50851

---
External triggers are embedded with information, which tells the user what to do next. — location: [652](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=652) ^ref-36872

---
Too many choices or irrelevant options can cause hesitation, confusion, or worse—abandonment. — location: [666](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=666) ^ref-41973

---
Paid Triggers — location: [674](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=674) ^ref-17194

---
companies generally use paid triggers to acquire new users and then leverage other triggers to bring them back. — location: [678](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=678) ^ref-48766

---
Earned Triggers — location: [680](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=680) ^ref-4859

---
Earned triggers are free in that they cannot be bought directly, but they often require investment in the form of time spent on public and media relations. — location: [680](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=680) ^ref-21565

---
Relationship Triggers — location: [684](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=684) ^ref-20385

---
One person telling others about a product or service can be a highly effective external trigger for action. — location: [685](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=685) ^ref-1485

---
Owned Triggers — location: [697](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=697) ^ref-10153

---
Owned triggers consume a piece of real estate in the user’s environment. — location: [697](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=697) ^ref-38536

---
For example, an app icon on the user’s phone screen, an e-mail newsletter to which the user subscribes, or an app update notification only appears if the user wants it there. — location: [698](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=698) ^ref-37402

---
owns a share of the user’s attention. — location: [700](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=700) ^ref-45649

---
owned triggers prompt repeat engagement until a habit is formed. — location: [703](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=703) ^ref-8470

---
When a product becomes tightly coupled with a thought, an emotion, or a preexisting routine, it leverages an internal trigger. — location: [708](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=708) ^ref-14018

---
you can’t see, touch, or hear an internal trigger. — location: [709](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=709) ^ref-63896

---
Emotions, particularly negative ones, are powerful internal triggers and greatly influence our daily routines. Feelings of boredom, loneliness, frustration, confusion, and indecisiveness often instigate a slight pain or irritation and prompt an almost instantaneous and often mindless action to quell the negative sensation. — location: [714](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=714) ^ref-55496

---
Gradually, these bonds cement into a habit as users turn to your product when experiencing certain internal triggers. — location: [725](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=725) ^ref-38168

---
example, participants with depressive symptoms tended to engage in very high e-mail usage — location: [733](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=733) ^ref-27026

---
In the case of internal triggers, the information about what to do next is encoded as a learned association in the user’s memory. — location: [746](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=746) ^ref-56315

---
It can take weeks or months of frequent usage for internal triggers to latch onto cues. — location: [748](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=748) ^ref-43321

---
New habits are sparked by external triggers, but associations with internal triggers are what keeps users hooked. — location: [749](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=749) ^ref-49563

---
The ultimate goal of a habit-forming product is to solve the user’s pain by creating an association so that the user identifies the company’s product or service as the source of relief. — location: [757](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=757) ^ref-13744

Just Enough Research writes, “When the research focuses on what people actually do (watch cat videos) rather than what they wish they did (produce cinema-quality home movies) it actually expands possibilities.” — location: [769](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=769) ^ref-46946

Looking for discrepancies exposes opportunities. Why do people really send text messages? Why do they take photos? — location: [771](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=771) ^ref-33601

So, we spend a lot of time writing what’s called user narratives.” — location: [776](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=776) ^ref-7273

---
Dorsey believes a clear description of users—their desires, emotions, the context with which they use the product—is paramount to building the right solution. — location: [782](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=782) ^ref-59135

---
In addition to Dorsey’s user narratives, tools like customer development,11 usability studies, and empathy maps12 are examples of methods for learning about potential users. — location: [783](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=783) ^ref-53075

Who is your product’s user? What is the user doing right before your intended habit? Come up with three internal triggers that could cue your user to action. Refer to the 5 Whys Method described in this chapter. Which internal trigger does your user experience most frequently? Finish this brief narrative using the most frequent internal trigger and the habit you are designing: “Every time the user (internal trigger), he/she (first action of intended habit).” Refer back to the question about what the user is doing right before the first action of the habit. What might be places and times to send an external trigger? How can you couple an external trigger as closely as possible to when the user’s internal trigger fires? — location: [836](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=836) ^ref-25112

---
Think of at least three conventional ways to trigger your user with current technology (e-mails, notifications, text messages, etc.). Then stretch yourself to come up with at least three crazy or currently impossible ideas for ways to trigger your user (wearable computers, biometric sensors, carrier pigeons, etc.). You could find that your crazy ideas spur some new approaches that may not be so nutty after all. In a few years new technologies will create all sorts of currently unimaginable triggering opportunities. — location: [845](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=845) ^ref-3681

---
however, if the user does not take action, the trigger is useless. — location: [853](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=853) ^ref-24321

To initiate action, doing must be easier than thinking. — location: [853](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=853) ^ref-57671

Fogg posits that there are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviors: (1) the user must have sufficient motivation; (2) the user must have the ability to complete the desired action; and (3) a trigger must be present to activate the behavior. — location: [859](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=859) ^ref-41069

motivation defines the level of desire to take that action. — location: [873](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NW01MKM&location=873) ^ref-25068
