✨How I Extract Maximum Value From Every eBook in 5 steps  
(and find your Easter Egg🥚)  
  
Ever read an amazing eBook but worried you'll forget the key points? I just finished [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAD8vxLEBCJoLCEyrfb3riD1ql8s9y0Aog_4)[Kieran Drew](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kierandrew123/)'s guide on irresistible content and wanted to maximize my takeaways.  
  
Here's my 5-step CODE system for making your eBook insights stick:  
‾‾‾‾‾  
1) Capture: Read & annotate on your eReader (mine's a ReMarkable)  
2) Organize: Store notes in your "second brain" (Obsidian for me)  
3) Distill: Write a summary of YOUR key insights  
4) Express: Share your learnings (like this post!)  
5) Amplify: Use AI tools for deeper analysis (I leverage Obsidian Smart Connections)  
  
Bonus: Find the hidden Easter egg 🥚 in my slides!

## Content preparation
I just read Kieran Drews highly valuable eBook with 10 tips to make your content irresistible. But how can I make sure that I  leverage that reading? Will I remember these 39 pages? 

To make key insights from the eBook stick, I processed it through my Capture-Organize-Distill-Express flow. 

I share 5 steps to convert your eBooks to your knowledge and amplify with AI. (AND... find your little Easter Egg 🥚 inside the slides)

You can CODE your knowledge this way:
✪ Capture your eBook to Read+Annotate on ReMarkable (or your eBook device)
✪ Organize the annotated version in your Second Brain. I use Obsidian.
✪ Write your Distilled Version that summarizes your Key Insights. This is your unique extraction and based on what is important for you.
✪ Express via Working Out Loud. I use my digital garden and for example this LinkedIn post. A first instance of applying my learnings. 
✪ Amplify with AI. Explore new connections, get a super distilled version. I use Smart Connections in Obsidian.

## Rule of One
Problem: Make key insights from eBooks stick
Solution: CODE and amplify AI
Story: my approach
One call: Follow me
