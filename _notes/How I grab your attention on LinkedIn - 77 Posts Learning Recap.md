How I grab your attention on LinkedIn  
(ðŸ“Š My insights from 77 posts, 78K impressions, and 780 comments analyzed with [Julius.ai](http://julius.ai/))  

âœª 'Second Brain' and note-taking concepts connected with AI topped the charts, sparking rich discussions.  
âœª My Power MBA journey resonated deeply  
âœª 'Women in Leadership' with high engagement too  
  
Most Likes for posts celebrating achievements and self-reflection.  
  
Highest engagement with?  
âœª My Insightful note-taking and mastering knowledge management tips  
âœª The evolving landscape of remote work  
âœª Building confidence  
  
Compilations, carousels, book covers and succinct models work best for me.  
While lists and complex graphs miss the mark.  
  
Surprisingly, 'How to make decisionsâ€˜, 'Wardley Mapping' and â€šLeadershipâ€˜ fell flat. Perhaps terms are too niche, some topics too broad.
