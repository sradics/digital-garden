How I stretch out of comfort zone each day  
(4 steps and why comparison matters)  
  
Want to push past your comfort zone? I experience this strong combination for pushing through:  
â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾  
âœª Find someone slightly ahead of you. This motivates to catch up!  
âœª Set clear goals. What's the big picture?  
âœª Track your progress. Small wins!  
âœª Knowing your current abilities  
  
I use this in my workouts. Instead of dreading how long is left, I focus on beating my previous time and hitting mini-goals along the way.  
  
For my Peloton workouts (think competitive spin class), I find that...  
â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾  
âœª looking at people working out at a similar level pushes me to keep them at bay  
âœª relative comparison to output measures of others is my orientation how to reach the top  
âœª looking at the a challenging goal just out of reach provides me with my push through target  
âœª setting mental boosters, like reaching a total output above a threshold, burning at least 1k. This way I can tap into my reserves.

## Content preparation

To push myself out of my comfort zone in daily activities I recommend to use close measurements. 

I experience a strong combination for pushing through:
+ Set clear goals. What's the big picture?
+ Find healthy competition. Who's slightly ahead of you?
+ Track your progress. Small wins matter!
+ Knowing your own current abilities 

I use this in my workouts. Instead of dreading how long is left, I focus on beating my previous time and hitting mini-goals along the way.

When I'm in my daily workout I push through the session and stretch out of my comfort zone by:
+ looking at close followers pushes me to keep them at bay
+ looking at the top position provides me with my push through goal
+ relative comparison to output measures of others .. my orientation how to reach the top
+ setting mental boosters, like reaching a total output above a threshold, burning at least 1k. This way I can tap into my reserves.
