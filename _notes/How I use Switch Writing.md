## LinkedIn Post

How I use Switch Writing to develop my posts

â†’ up to 20 times back and forth with AI
â†’ to 

(Abrupt ending with TO for demo purpose ðŸ˜‰)

With this headline I feed ChatGPT and prompt:

ðŸ¤– â€”â€”â€”  
What state is a reader in when reading this headline? 
What are emotions, what expectations?
â€”â€”â€” ðŸ¤–

Output Emotions:
Curiosity â†’ What is Switch Writing?
Interest   â†’ How does he use AI?
Intrigue   â†’ Why 20 times?

Output Expectations:
â†’ Learning a New Technique
â†’ Detailed Process
â†’ Practical Insights

ðŸ¤– â€”â€”â€”  
What would follow next?
â€”â€”â€” ðŸ¤–

AI gives me already a very good answer!

ðŸ¤– â€”â€”â€”

Apply for:

... provide your text snippet
â€”â€”â€” ðŸ¤–

This is my output, slightly polished

SWITCH WRITING with AI:

â†’ Explore multiple perspectives
â†’ Engage in an iterative process
â†’ Go back and forth up to 20 times
â†’ Refine ur ideas for clarity and depth
â†’ Challenge assumptions to tune outcomes
â†’ Polish content to resonate with the audience
