How I use my 23 years of knowledge to design impactful leadership sessions  
(Tired of reinventing the wheel? Use your Second Brain)  
  
It's tough to quickly leverage years of knowledge for creative work, right?  
  
At [Blinkist](https://www.linkedin.com/company/blinkist/), I use the Capture-Organize-Distill-Express approach.  
My CODE - to design impactful leadership programs  
(26 collaborative learning sessions and counting!).  
  
It takes deep dives into learning theory, years of facilitation experience, and a whole lot of diverse sources.  
  
I use my Second Brain + AI tools to:  
âœª CAPTURE key insights  
âœª ORGANIZE my learnings (PARA for the win),  
âœª DISTILL complex concepts, and  
âœª EXPRESS them in unique sessions covering e.g.  
Feedback, DEI, Hybrid Work, Leadership and more.  
  
It is fascinating how your creativity is amplified by walking through your notes from years of learning and leveraging AI for further discovery.

One person:
Course Designer and knowledge expert

One Problem: 
To leverage years of knowledge and build on creativity it is super helpful to have knowledge available in a fast to grasp and high quality format, that can be applied right away without the need to re-learn everything again.

One Story:
At Blinkist I can fully leverage my compound knowledge and Capture-Organize-Distill-Express approach for managing knowledge. 

I designed so far 26 different leadership learning sessions as part of our group coaching for leaders program. Many in collaboration with the awesome Angie. 

For designing each session I had to build on:
+ my 23 years experience in facilitation
+ a deeper understanding of collaborative learning
+ insights from How To Learn
+ and immersing into current approaches for building Cohort Based, highly interactive group coaching 

Session topics are ranging from topic areas like Feedback, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Personal & Team Skills, Hybrid Work, Agile and more. 

One Solution:
To design sessions I scan through many books by looking for Key Insights leveraging Blinkist. For deep dive I read books. I capture and distill information from studies, TED talks, PodCasts and partially run through courses too. AND I build on my Second Brain and all my knowledge externalized so far.

In addition I leverage AI to come up with interaction elements like Role Plays, group exercises, ideas for session flow and icebreakers. 

For organizing this rich set of information I leverage the PARA organizing principle. Each session design becomes a project. I build on intermediate knowledge packets that I already created in my Second Brain as is stored in areas. It is fascinating how creativity is amplified by walking through your notes from years of learning and leveraging AI for further discovery.

Each session is an Expression of myself. The final stage of applying the CODE approach.
