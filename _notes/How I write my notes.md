Focused writing increases clarity and retention.

Optimize your setup now.

Over time, I developed my own style for making notes. 
I'm all in with the my note-making Swiss-army-tool Obsidian. 

With more than three years practice and thousands of notes created, 
let's look at six core elements I use for my daily focus.
â€”â€”â€”

â†’ I focus on the current line I'm writing. 
The line is always centered on the screen. Other lines are visible but blurred. 

â†’ I have immediate access to recent notes I've used. 
As thoughts often connect, I scan through topics I've just explored parallel to my writing.

â†’ The outline of my current note is always visible next to my writing window. 
This provides an easy overview and adjustment of my structure.

â†’ I have my visual elements ready
Especially for writing my LinkedIn posts, I have to formatting elements like â†’ âž  â†³ ... side by side with my main writing window. 

This enables fast access and avoids distraction.

â†’ I use the Minimal Theme 
One highlight is colored headlines with different colors for headline levels, 
which is a simple way to orient in a note.

â†’ I learned the Obsidian editor functions, and two magic ones for me are:
â‡¢ Drag and Drop linking to other documents. 
Which makes it so easy to connect thoughts.

â‡¢ Knowing the Markdown syntax makes writing and simple formatting much easier
I've memorized the important shortcuts.

In essence, it is about a setup that:

â†’ supports my flow
â†’ creates a focused writing experience
â†’ make access to my other thoughts simple

To get there I recommend:

â†’ experimenting with your setup to support you best
â†’ becoming one one with your writing environment
â†’ enjoying the journey and iterations

What is ONE writing tip that helps with your writing?
