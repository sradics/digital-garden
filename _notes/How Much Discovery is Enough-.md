# How Much Discovery is Enough-
## Metadata
* [Source](https://itamargilad.com/how-much-product-discovery/)
* Published Date: 2022-07-07
* Author: [[Itamar Gilad]]

## Highlights
* **Never launch anything solely based on opinions**
* It’s ok to release minor tweaks based on assessment
	* **Having supporting data (without testing) is enough to launch only very small, low-risk, easy-to-revert changes**
	* Everything else should be validated through tests and experiments.
* **How much validation** you need depends on: 
	* **the cost of building the idea** in full
	* **how risky it is**
	* your **risk tolerance.**
## Opinions (Confidence Level <= 0.1 out of 10)
This form of evidence is based on the self conviction of a single person or a small group of like-minded people (who aren’t the intended user).

## Assessment (0.1 < Confidence Level ≦ 0.5)
* ICE analysis
* Projections and business models — Using back-of the envelope calculations, business model canvas, and other forms of business/tech analysis to refine our estimates of impact and ease.
* Risk analysis — For example through assumption mapping (for reference consider Cagan’s Four Big Risks)
* Reviews — Including peer reviews, expert reviews, management reviews, and stakeholder reviews.

## Data (0.5 < Confidence Level ≦ 3)
* Customer/user requests 
* Customer/user interviews 
* Field studies 
* Log and usage data 
* Competitive research 
* Market research 
* Surveys 
* Other sources
* Anecdotal data (Confidence Level of 1.0 or less) comes from a small set of data points: 1-3 users/customers expressing
* Market data (Confidence Level between 1.0 and 3.0) comes from larger datasets.
* 13 out of 20 potential customers we interviewed rated HDR-support as very important in their choice of video platform * 68% of consumer devices support HDR video * 3 out of 11 competitors have HDR support; 4 more have it on their roadmap
* Anecdotal data shows that at least someone outside the building
	* We should use anecdotal evidence to OK just very low-effort, very low-risk ideas.
* but if we don't have the capacity, these are examples of ideas where it might be ok to take the risk:
* Incremental features that add new functionality (rather than change or subtract), and are unlikely to annoy anyone, for example HDR support
* Redesigns of parts of the UI that users don’t visit often — e.g. the settings page
* Short-duration, in-product promos and calls-to-action
* We definitely don’t want to bloat the product with features no one uses.

## Tests and Experiments (3 < Confidence Level)
* Testing means putting a version of the idea in front of users/customers and measuring the reactions.
* **Early-stage tests use a “fake product”** or a prototype before the product is built, for example landing pages, wizards of Oz, concierge services, and prototype usability studies.
* **Mid-stage tests**, for example internal team dogfood, early adopter programs, alpha, real product-based usability tests, **use a rough and incomplete version of the idea with a small group of users**.
* **Late-stage tests** (e.g. betas, labs, previews) **use an almost-complete version of the idea with a larger group of users**
* Split tests (e.g. a/b, multivariate) test complete versions of the idea with lots of users, and include a control element to reduce the odds of false results.
* **Launch tests use partial roll-outs to test the finished idea on a large scale.**
* questions about value in use, usability, and adoption and usage patterns. These are more expensive tests, and they’re enough to greenlight most medium risk and/or medium cost ideas.
* a new core feature, removing or replacing an existing feature, a major redesign, minor new product.
* 1) when the idea is going to affect all/most users in a big way
* and you want to ensure it’s bullet-proof, or 2) when some assumptions
* can only be validated with large amounts of data.
* use them for cases where you need quantitative data to validate the assumptions,
* Will people choose this option? Will we earn more money?
* Will retention not degrade?
* At a minimum we’d like to ensure that our most critical assumptions, the ones that may make the idea useless, are validated.
* We start with cheaper modes of validation (assessment, data gathering, early-stage tests), and move to more expensive ones only if the idea still looks good.
* Every time we collect new evidence we should reevaluate the idea and decide what to do next.
