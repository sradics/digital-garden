## Highlights
* We’ll look at how a roadmap can help you connect your work with that of others and reclaim control over your product.
* A good product roadmap must be visually appealing, easily accessible, and clear enough for anyone to scan for answers to the following questions:
* What exactly are we doing? · Why are we doing it in the first place? · What does this have to do with our OKRs?
* OKRs are defined
* It encompasses the milestones you will attain in releasing those features.
* A theme-based product roadmap is based on this premise, and the benefits are enormous and immediate.
* A theme-based roadmap substitute with time horizons made up of three columns: 1. Now — Tasks that you are currently working on 2. Next — Tasks that are coming up soon 3. Later — Tasks that you’d like to work on in the future or need to do a bit more research before you move on
* A theme-based map replaces this with themes, which appear as cards on your roadmap.
* themes are “a promise to solve problems, not build features.”
* Those words come from the realization that almost any product will receive a flood of customer feedback and feature requests that revolve around a single universal problem.
* What exactly are we doing? 2. Why are we doing it in the first place? 3. What does this have to do with our OKRs?
