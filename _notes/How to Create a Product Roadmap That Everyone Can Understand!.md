## Highlights
* A good ==product roadmap must be visually appealing, easily accessible, and clear enough for anyone to scan for answers== to the following questions:
	* ==What exactly are we doing?== 
	* ==Why are we doing it in the first place?== 
	* ==What does this have to do with our OKRs?==
* It ==encompasses the milestones== you will attain in releasing those features.
* A ==theme-based product roadmap== is based on this premise, and the benefits are enormous and immediate.
* A ==theme-based roadmap substitute with time horizons== made up of three columns: 
	+ ==Now ‚Äî Tasks that you are currently working on== 
	+ ==Next ‚Äî Tasks that are coming up soon== 
	+ ==Later ‚Äî Tasks that you‚Äôd like to work on in the future or need to do a bit more research before you move on==

* A theme-based map replaces this with themes, which appear as cards on your roadmap.
* ==themes are ‚Äúa promise to solve problems, not build features.‚Äù==
	* Those words come from the realization that almost any product will receive a flood of customer feedback and feature requests that revolve around a single universal problem.
