‘We must form a committee to investigate the possibility of proceeding. That’s the answer. A committee. Who shall we choose to chair the committee?’ — location: [798](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005CUSEEC&location=798) ^ref-28570

Knowing isn’t doing what you need to do, my son; Telling me you know is only bluffing on the run; Knowing isn’t doing; Doing isn’t knowing; Nothing but the knowing and the doing gets it done. — location: [817](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005CUSEEC&location=817) ^ref-37716
