## Highlights
If something can be observed in any way at all, it lends itself to some type of measurement method. — location: [553](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00INUYS2U&location=553) ^ref-26874

---
virtually always, solved by relatively simple measurement methods. — location: [555](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00INUYS2U&location=555) ^ref-46749

---
seemingly impossible measurements start with asking the right questions. Then, even once questions are framed the right — location: [560](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00INUYS2U&location=560) ^ref-38728

---
Things like time, budget, patent ownership, and so on are good examples of things that you cannot literally touch though they are observable in other ways. — location: [567](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00INUYS2U&location=567) ^ref-48463

---
The presumption of immeasurability is, in fact, so strong that no attempt is even made to make any observation that might tell you something about the alleged immeasurable that you might be surprised to learn. — location: [573](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00INUYS2U&location=573) ^ref-7102

---
Yet, in many organizations, because intangibles like these were assumed to be immeasurable, the decision was not nearly as informed as it could have been. — location: [583](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00INUYS2U&location=583) ^ref-19360

---
something as intangible when the measurement method isn’t immediately apparent. — location: [584](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00INUYS2U&location=584) ^ref-29422

---
that the benefit couldn’t possibly be measured. Consequently, some of the most important strategic proposals were being overlooked in favor of minor cost-saving ideas simply because everyone knew how to measure some things and didn’t know how to measure others. — location: [592](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00INUYS2U&location=592) ^ref-1897

---
In addition, many major investments were approved with no plans for measuring their effectiveness after they were implemented. — location: [594](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00INUYS2U&location=594) ^ref-59088

---
a “must have” so that the question of the degree to which the intangible matters is never considered in a rational, quantitative way. — location: [597](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00INUYS2U&location=597) ^ref-56409

---
is measurable but that sufficient data is lacking or that getting the data is not economically feasible. This belief—not usually based on any specific calculation—is as big an obstacle to measurement as any other. — location: [603](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00INUYS2U&location=603) ^ref-52789

Everything else is a matter of clearly defining what you observe, why you care — location: [634](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00INUYS2U&location=634) ^ref-35068

about it, and some (often surprisingly trivial) math. — location: [635](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00INUYS2U&location=635) ^ref-58233

---
The first reason—and the focus of this book—is that we should care about a measurement because it informs key decisions. Second, a measurement might also be — location: [638](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00INUYS2U&location=638) ^ref-3043

---
taken because it has its own market value (e.g., results of a consumer survey) and could be sold to other parties for a profit. — location: [639](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00INUYS2U&location=639) ^ref-22407

---
Decision makers usually have imperfect information (i.e., uncertainty) about the best choice for a decision. These decisions should be modeled quantitatively because (as we will see) quantitative models have a favorable track record compared to unaided expert judgment. Measurements inform uncertain decisions. For any decision or set of decisions, there is a large combination of things to measure and ways to measure them—but perfect certainty is rarely a realistic option. — location: [648](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00INUYS2U&location=648) ^ref-1603

---
Although subjective judgment informed by real data may be better than intuition alone, choices made entirely intuitively dilute the value of measurement. — location: [657](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00INUYS2U&location=657) ^ref-11718

If the outcome of a decision in question is highly uncertain and has significant consequences, then measurements that reduce uncertainty about it have a high value. — location: [680](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00INUYS2U&location=680) ^ref-27435

Compute the value of additional information. (If none, go to step 5.) Measure where information value is high. (Return to steps 2 and 3 until further measurement is not needed.)

the effects of samples, we find that we should not rely on our intuition about what a sample may tell us or not.

Suppose now we had equal wins (you win $10 if I guess the wrong majority color and I win $10 if I’m right) but you charged me $2 on each urn to take a single marble sample. Should I pay the $2? In this case, my average payoff now without the sample is $0 (I win $10 half the time and lose $10 half the time). But if I took one sample from the urn before each bet, that information increased my average net win to 75% × $10 + 25% × (–$10) = $5.

individual observations; not consistent or dependent on known variables (although such errors follow the rules of probability in large groups). Accuracy: A characteristic of a measurement having a low systemic error—that is, not consistently over- or underestimating a value. In some fields this is used synonymously with “validity.” Precision: A characteristic of a measurement having a low random error; highly consistent results even if they are far from the true value. In some fields of research, the terms “reliability” and “consistency” will be used in the same way. — location: [4513](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00INUYS2U&location=4513) ^ref-1507

If, in a purely hypothetical situation, you have a project manager who always underestimates actual project costs by exactly half, then you will still have a perfect correlation of one.

What we really want to know is the probability of a first-year profit, depending on whether the market test was successful.

Suppose, for example, we wanted to know the chance of getting exactly four heads out of 10 flips if the chance of getting heads is 50%.
