writing down of the argument is the smallest part of its development. — location: [69](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=69) ^ref-50909

**good, productive writing is based on good note-taking**. — location: [94](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=94) ^ref-55810

---
Getting something that is already written into another written piece is incomparably **easier than assembling everything in your mind** and then trying to retrieve it from there. — location: [94](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=94) ^ref-27603

---
how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand (Duckworth and Seligman, 2005; Tangney, Baumeister, and Boone, 2004). — location: [104](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=104) ^ref-38223

---
Doing the work required and doing it in a smart way leads, somehow unsurprisingly, to success. — location: [106](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=106) ^ref-61652

---
**Willpower is, as far as we know today,1 a limited resource that depletes quickly** and is also not that much up for improvement over the long term — location: [109](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=109) ^ref-59849

---
and self-discipline have much more to do with our environment than with ourselves — location: [112](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=112) ^ref-8604

---
Nobody needs willpower not to eat a chocolate bar when there isn’t one around. And nobody needs willpower to do something they wanted to do anyway. — location: [113](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=113) ^ref-20728

---
Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time. — location: [116](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=116) ^ref-15823

---
**“I never force myself to do anything I don’t feel like. Whenever I am stuck, I do something else.”** — location: [121](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=121) ^ref-57854

---
A good structure is something you can trust. It relieves you from the burden of remembering and keeping track of everything. — location: [123](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=123) ^ref-38965

---
you can start **focusing on what is important**: — location: [125](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=125) ^ref-48528

---
**A good structure enables flow**, — location: [127](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=127) ^ref-49476

---
Still, we often struggle the most with procrastination and motivation. — location: [130](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=130) ^ref-21694

---
Having a clear structure to work in is completely different from making plans about something. **If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself; it makes you inflexible.** — location: [133](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=133) ^ref-53710

---
To keep going **according to plan, you have to push yourself and employ willpower**. This is not only demotivating, but also **unsuitable for an open-ended process like research**, — location: [134](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=134) ^ref-36286

---
**The challenge is to structure one’s workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward**. — location: [139](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=139) ^ref-6739

---
learning in a way that generates real insight, is accumulative and sparks new ideas. — location: [145](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=145) ^ref-8176

---
It takes them longer to find a good idea to write about because they know from experience that the first idea is rarely that great — location: [148](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=148) ^ref-24492

---
They spend more time in the library to get a better overview — location: [149](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=149) ^ref-27706

---
poor students often feel more successful (until they are tested), because they don’t experience much self-doubt. In psychology, this is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect (Kruger and Dunning, 1999). — location: [157](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=157) ^ref-52112

---
That means that those who are not very good at something tend to be overly confident, while **those who have made an effort tend to underestimate their abilities**. — location: [160](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=160) ^ref-37659

---
Good students, on the other hand, constantly raise the bar for themselves as they focus on what they haven’t learned — location: [164](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=164) ^ref-53655

---
suffer from what psychologists call **imposter syndrome, the feeling that you are not really up to the job**, even though, of all people, they are (Clance and Imes 1978; Brems et al. 1994). — location: [165](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=165) ^ref-45277

---
increasingly complex body of content, especially because it is not just about collecting thoughts, but about making connections and sparking new ideas. — location: [172](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=172) ^ref-24774

---
**The best way to deal with complexity is to keep things as simple as possible and to follow a few basic principles**. — location: [177](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=177) ^ref-33733

---
The principle of **GTD is to collect everything that needs to be taken care of in one place and process it in a standardised way**. — location: [198](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=198) ^ref-12025

---
but it **forces us to make clear choices and regularly check if our tasks still fit into the bigger picture**. — location: [200](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=200) ^ref-6865

---
**Only if nothing else is lingering in our working memory and taking up valuable mental resources can we experience what Allen calls a “mind like water”** — location: [201](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=201) ^ref-10750

---
deals with the fact that most distractions do not come so much from our environment, but our own minds. — location: [204](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=204) ^ref-33813

---
Writing is not a linear process. We constantly have to jump back and forth between different tasks. — location: [213](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=213) ^ref-9640

---
the secret to a successful organization lies in the holistic perspective. — location: [218](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=218) ^ref-34999

---
When it comes to writing, everything, from research to proofreading, is closely connected. — location: [222](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=222) ^ref-16275

---
**Only if you can trust your system, only if you really know that everything will be taken care of, will your brain let go and let you focus on the task at hand.** — location: [224](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=224) ^ref-41895

---
**Whenever he encountered something remarkable or had a thought about what he read, he made a note.** — location: [231](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=231) ^ref-34643

---
He realised that **one idea, one note was only as valuable as its context, which was not necessarily the context it was taken from**. — location: [237](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=237) ^ref-40709

---
how **one idea could relate and contribute to different contexts**. — location: [238](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=238) ^ref-19616

---
slip-box became his dialogue partner, main idea generator and productivity engine. It helped him to structure and develop his thoughts. — location: [240](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=240) ^ref-26698

---
In 30 years, he published 58 books and hundreds of articles, translations not included. — location: [258](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=258) ^ref-35378

---
“**I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment**, I put the matter aside and do something else.” — location: [278](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=278) ^ref-7088

---
Only if the work is set up in a way that is flexible enough to allow these small and constant adjustments can we keep our interest, motivation and work aligned — location: [288](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=288) ^ref-1181

---
Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that **success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place** — location: [292](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=292) ^ref-13557

---
It is about **having the right tools and knowing how to use them** – and very few understand that you need both. — location: [297](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=297) ^ref-28914

---
**two slip-boxes: a bibliographical one**, which contained the references and brief notes on the content of the literature, and the main one in which he collected and generated his ideas, mainly in response to what he read. — location: [319](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=319) ^ref-27286

---
Whenever he read something, he would write the bibliographic information on one side of a card and make brief notes about the content on the other — location: [321](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=321) ^ref-43170

---
he would **look at his brief notes and think about their relevance for his own thinking and writing.** — location: [323](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=323) ^ref-19224

---
He then would **turn to the main slip-box and write his ideas, comments and thoughts on new pieces of paper, using only one for each idea and restricting himself to one side of the paper, to make it easier to read them later without having to take them out of the box**. — location: [324](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=324) ^ref-7693

---
**in full sentences and with explicit references to the literature** from which he drew his material. — location: [328](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=328) ^ref-15669

---
More often than not, a new note would directly follow up on another note and would become part of a longer chain of notes. — location: [329](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=329) ^ref-28247

---
add references to notes somewhere else — location: [330](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=330) ^ref-46461

---
Some were directly related and read more like comments, others contained not-so-obvious connections. Rarely would a note stay in isolation. — location: [331](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=331) ^ref-30221

---
It was very much **like a translation where you use different words that fit a different context, but strive to keep the original meaning as truthfully as possible.** — location: [333](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=333) ^ref-37459

---
The trick is that he did **not organise his notes by topic**, but in the rather abstract way of giving them fixed numbers. — location: [336](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=336) ^ref-55774

---
If a new note was relevant or directly referred to an already existing note, such as a comment, correction or addition, he added it directly behind the previous note. — location: [337](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=337) ^ref-31401

---
If the existing note had the number 22, the new note would become note number 23. If 23 already existed, he named the new note 22a. — location: [338](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=338) ^ref-29163

---
Another way is by **adding a link on this and/or the other note, which could be anywhere in the system**. — location: [342](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=342) ^ref-46415

---
Luhmann was able to add the same note to different contexts. — location: [346](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=346) ^ref-39697

---
Notes with a sorted collection of links are, of course, good entry points. — location: [349](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=349) ^ref-25904

We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains. — location: [354](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=354) ^ref-21707

---
It would certainly make things a lot easier if you already had everything you need right in front of you: The ideas, the arguments, the quotes, long developed passages, complete with bibliography and references. — location: [364](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=364) ^ref-34522

**If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words**. — location: [389](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=389) ^ref-38734

---
If there is one thing the experts agree on, then it is this: You have to externalise your ideas, you have to write. — location: [394](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=394) ^ref-22401

---
If we write, it is more likely that we understand what we read and remember what we learn and that our thoughts make sense. — location: [395](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=395) ^ref-5811

Always have something at hand to write with to capture every idea that pops into your mind. — location: [400](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=400) ^ref-31429

---
Go through the notes you made in step one or two (ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant) and think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests. — location: [409](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=409) ^ref-42604

The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions. — location: [411](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=411) ^ref-718

---
**Does the new information contradict, correct, support or add to what you already have** — location: [412](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=412) ^ref-17841

---
**Can you combine ideas to generate something new? What questions are triggered by them?** — location: [413](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=413) ^ref-37651

---
Write exactly one note for each idea and write as if you were writing for someone else: Use full sentences, disclose your sources, make references and try to be as precise, clear and brief as possible. — location: [414](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=414) ^ref-21307

---
Look to which note the new one directly relates or, if it does not relate directly to any other note yet, just file it behind the last one. — location: [419](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=419) ^ref-5429

bottom up from within the system. See what is there, what is missing and what questions arise. — location: [424](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=424) ^ref-49830

**Read more to challenge, strengthen, change and develop your arguments according to the new information you are learning about.** — location: [425](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=425) ^ref-55286

After a while, you will have developed ideas far enough to decide on a topic to write about. — location: [432](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=432) ^ref-59172

---
Look through the connections and collect all the relevant notes on this topic (most of the relevant notes will already be in partial order), copy them into an outliner5 and bring them in order. — location: [434](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=434) ^ref-45727

---
Don’t wait until you have everything together. — location: [436](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=436) ^ref-7482

---
You build connections within the slip-box, which in itself will spark new ideas. You write them down and add them to the discussion. — location: [454](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=454) ^ref-31108

**Good tools do not add features and more options to what we already have, but help to reduce distractions from the main work, which here is thinking.** — location: [485](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=485) ^ref-23839

---
Something to write with and something to write on (pen and paper will do) • A reference management system (Zotero, Citavi or whatever works best for you) • The slip-box (paper or digital). • An editor (Word, LaTeX, Google Docs or whatever works best for you). — location: [490](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=490) ^ref-54525

You need something to capture ideas whenever and wherever they pop into your head. — location: [494](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=494) ^ref-39859

They only function as a reminder of a thought and are not meant to capture — location: [496](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=496) ^ref-51241

If you use other tools, make sure everything ends up in one place, a central inbox or something like that, — location: [498](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=498) ^ref-20372

---
I strongly recommend using a free program like Zotero, — location: [500](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=500) ^ref-52814

strongly recommend using one that allows backlinking like Obsidian or Roam Research, — location: [514](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=514) ^ref-2522

**Everybody knows how to handle a flute (you blow into one end and press your fingers on the holes according to the notes you are playing), but nobody would try it out once and then judge the instrument on what they hear**. — location: [523](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=523) ^ref-8974

Good comparison of tools

Focusing on writing as if nothing else counts does not necessarily mean you should do everything else less well, but it certainly makes you do everything else differently. — location: [592](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=592) ^ref-50733

It will change the way you read as well: You will become more focused on the most relevant aspects, knowing that you cannot write down everything. — location: [598](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=598) ^ref-11774
