# How to begin
Major goals should be **daunting**, **important** and **thrilling** 

## Step 1 - Sketch the goal
Do a first sketch of the goal to make it more tangible and combine it with quick word associations (reminds me of [[Stroh im Kopf]] and using KaWas und KaGas).

The word associations should be connected with **daunting**, **important** and **thrilling**.

The sketch will help phrasing the goal.

## Step 2 - Mission statement
Create a first mission statement. 

## Step 3 - Spousish Test
Do the **spousish** (with someone who really knows you) test.
+ reality check
+ catch problems
+ discover blind spot

Watch out for extreme reactions.

## Step 4 - Goldy locks zone test
Is the goal too small or too big? Look for the perfect spot.
Tweak the sketch and mission statement.

## Step 5 - Add SPICE
Add some spice to the goal:
+ Can you aim higher?
+ Change timeline
+ Include team power?
+ Extend reach?
+ Lift outcomes?

Change the mission statement and experiment with powerful verbs and adjectives.

## Step 6 - Status Quo and Rewards check
What are the benefit of **not** taking on that goal? What are the rewards for not doing it?

What are the costs of **not** pursuing the goal?

## Step 7 - Move forward
**MOVE** ... with small steps, but MOVE.
And do a recap of your progress and success every 6 weeks.
