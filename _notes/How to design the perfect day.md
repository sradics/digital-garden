## Highlights
* You can still refer 2 friends until the end of this course and even afterwards to get my personal Weekly Review Cheatsheet
* measuring happiness:
* When our expectations are too high, reality fails to keep pace. (Happiness, negative.)
* Knowledge workers have the capacity to do 2-4 hours of high-quality work per day.
* 5-step blueprint for designing the perfect day.
* 1. Busyness is the absence of priorities
* “It’s not that I’m too busy to exercise. It’s that I’ve chosen to not make it a priority.“
* “If I could only work 2 hours per week on my business, what would I do?”
* Spend 10 minutes on the weekend to map out your week (which btw, would be great at part of your Weekly Review).
* Simply picking a $10K task for each day will be more than enough.
* So start small. 25 to maybe 45 Minutes per day for one $10K task - and just see what happens.
* 3. Protect this house
* Allocate a fixed time period to a planned activity. You work on the activity during the fixed time period and stop working on it once the time is up – then, you assess whether you’ve reached your planned goals.
* Manage your energy (and not your time)
* What if instead we organized our days around our energy?
* In the yellow zone (i.e. medium energy) are Zoom calls (with clients and prospects),
* improvements to my processes and infrastructure, marketing, ops and customer research.
* hit the red zone, I step into the endless buffet of $10 work.
* The Power of Full Engagement.
* energy as “the fundamental currency of high performance.”
* Energy can be systematically expanded and regularly renewed by establishing specific rituals—behaviors that are intentionally practiced and precisely scheduled, with the goal of making them unconscious and automatic as quickly as possible.
* Use your emotions to build momentum
* But once the interaction starts to provide feedback to the person’s skills, it usually begins to be intrinsically rewarding.”
* combines a not-so-fun task (updating your mid-year OKRs) with a fun task (testing out a new software tool).
* Why am I actually doing this work? * In a decade, what would I regret not having enjoyed more? * Did I show up for the people I love the most?
* string together a series of small wins, your confidence and energy will exponentially grow.
