* measuring happiness:
* When our ==expectations are too high, reality fails to keep pace==. (Happiness, negative.)
* ==Knowledge workers have the capacity to do 2-4 hours of high-quality work per day==.

### 5-step blueprint for designing the perfect day.
#### 1. ==Busyness is the absence of priorities==
* “It’s not that I’m too busy to exercise. It’s that I’ve chosen to not make it a priority.“
* ==“If I could only work 2 hours per week on my business, what would I do?”==
#### 2. The week start in sunday (for a mere 10 minutes)
* ==Spend 10 minutes on the weekend to map out your wee==k (which btw, would be great at part of your Weekly Review).
* Simply ==picking a $10K task for each day will be more than enough.==
* So start small. ==25 to maybe 45 Minutes per day for one $10K task== - and just see what happens.
#### 3. Protect this house
* ==Allocate a fixed time period to a planned activity==. You work on the activity during the fixed time period and stop working on it once the time is up – then, you assess whether you’ve reached your planned goals.
#### 4. ==Manage your energy== (and not your time)
* What if instead we ==organized our days around our energy==?
* In the ==yellow zone (i.e. medium energy) are Zoom calls== (with clients and prospects),
* improvements to my processes and infrastructure, marketing, ops and customer research.
* hit the ==red zone, I step into the endless buffet of $10 work==.
* The Power of Full Engagement.
* ==energy as “the fundamental currency of high performance.”==
* Energy can be systematically ==expanded and regularly renewed by establishing specific rituals==—behaviors that are intentionally practiced and precisely scheduled, with the goal of making them unconscious and automatic as quickly as possible.
#### 5. Use your emotions to build momentum
* But once the interaction starts to provide feedback to the person’s skills, it usually begins to be intrinsically rewarding.”
* ==combines a not-so-fun task (updating your mid-year OKRs) with a fun task (testing out a new software tool)==.
* ==string together a series of small wins, your confidence and energy will exponentially grow.==

#### 6. Be kind to yourself
* ==Why am I actually doing this work?== 
* In a decade, what would I regret not having enjoyed more? 
* ==Did I show up for the people I love the most?==
