## Highlights

* The [[The Seven Principles For Making Marriage Work - John Gottman]],
	* intensity of relationship conflicts increases significantly
	* fatigue makes it impossible to have an emotional connection
* ==Resentment: The inverse of appreciation==
* ==Appreciation is defined as the “recognition and enjoyment of the good qualities of someone.”==
* paradox of delayed gratification – do you optimize for the journey or the destination?
* ==letting go of your ego is a much easier route== than digging your heels and trying to win the battle of who’s got it harder.
* ==“Resentment is like taking poison and waiting for the other person to die.”==
* ==relationships need a “waste elimination system”==
* apply the ==$10K Framework to this question and ask ourselves "what would truly move the needle?"==,
* “Until you ==make the unconscious conscious==, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.”
* ==What are you feeling right now?== 
* ==Where is this coming from?== (Note: not in a passive-aggressive tone) 
* ==How can I best support you right now?==
* Difficult Conversations, as Doug Stone,
* link between difficult conversations and our sense of self.
* ==What about your identity feels at risk?== 
* ==What does this mean to you?== 
* ==How would it feel if what you fear were true?==
* ==Bids are “any attempt from one partner to another for attention, affirmation, affection, or any other positive connection”==
* Bids are “==little moments” that slowly build up mutual trust==, funding what Gottman calls an “emotional bank account”
* ==86% of couples that “turned into their bids” stayed married==
* Yet to their subtle nature, ==bids can be easy to miss== – especially once resentment has hardened a relationship.
* ==Turning away can be devastating.== It’s even more devastating than “turning against” or rejecting the bid.
* Could or should I get better at making bids? How? 
* ==What keeps me from making bids?== 
* What is my impulse for turning? 
* ==Do I turn away or against more often than I turn towards?==
* It helps to ==make the apology specific==. “I apologize for raising my voice. I apologize for saying this mean thing.”
* ==“I appreciate you.”==
* ==Say it as often as possible. Just make sure you mean it. Just make sure you feel it.==
