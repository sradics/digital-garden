# [[How to distill from a paper book]]
## LinkedIn Post
[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_that-moment-when-you-realize-youve-highlighted-activity-7309831394740850689-zoKx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAA1M1pkBgWCYPhT45EpfLiHzViQqRWNCIv4)

That moment when you realize you've highlighted 400 passages in a paper book...

Today I got a small challenge for you.

This morning I finished reading $100M Leads from Alex Hormozi. It was a paper book, so while reading I did hundreds of highlights with a marker.

I want to have all these highlights available in my Second Brain, so I can connect them to my existing knowledge network.

What would be your approach to transfer such book notes to a digital, machine readable format?

We're talking about 270 pages with approximately 200-400 highlights. A wealth of knowledge waiting to be unlocked.

Would you:
â†’ Use OCR technology?
â†’ Manually type everything?
â†’ Use AI tools for image-to-text?
â†’ Or something entirely different?

Curious to get your thoughts on solving this puzzle. 

It's about making knowledge accessible and actionable.

I'll start with my approach today 
and will share my experience with you. 

To not influence your thinking, 
I won't yet expose my method.

Have a great start to your week. 
And happy mind wandering.
