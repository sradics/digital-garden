* The average manager has 7 direct reports (and assuming 40 hour work weeks) is responsible for the direction of 280 hours a week.

* I quickly came to the realization that one of my most important roles was to ==set the direction to ensure that our ladder was leaning against the right wall==.
* ==support our broader vision while keeping us accountable on a much shorter time frame==.
* system to succeed, it needed to be: 
	* **Lightweight** 
	* **Actionable** 
	* **Easy to maintain** 
	* **Understood by everybody** 
	* **Supportive of experimentation and pivots**
* The purpose is to take a ==longer-term goal (i.e. an Objective) and pair it against some measurable milestones (i.e. some Key Results)==.
* Why is this OKR important to the company? 
* How will the company be changed if we succeed?
* look for a ‚Äúunifying theme‚Äù that will spread across departments:
* Objective, Perdoo‚Äôs blog recommends ==three types of Objectives==: 
	* ==Build==: Create something that didn‚Äôt exist before (like an onboarding sequence) 
	* ==Improve==: Make something that already exists better 
	* ==Innovate==: Do something drastic, on your product, marketing or organizational structure.
* One of the trickiest parts of ==Key Results is that they need to be outcomes==, not outputs.
* These are a few ==poor key results==: 
	* Interview 5 CTO candidates 
	* Make 20 outbound sales calls 
	* Ship 3 new features 
+ ==Instead==, you‚Äôd want to ==measure the outcome== of these efforts: 
	* Make 3 new hires 
	* Generate $10,000 in new sales 
	* Increase time user engagement to 30 minutes a day
* we ==report weekly on our progress in a dedicated Slack channel==.
