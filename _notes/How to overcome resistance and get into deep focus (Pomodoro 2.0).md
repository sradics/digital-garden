## Highlights

* set a timer and commit to working without distractions for just 30 minutes. After that, add another 15 to 60 minutes – if you feel like it (spoiler: you probably will).
* three distinct phases. In phase 1, we struggle toward focus:
* it’s difficult to suppress our instinctive urges to distract
* takes 10-15 minutes.
* Maintaining deep focus and resisting our urges feels much less effortful, and we might even get into the flow state. Phase 2 lasts 45-60 minutes.
* After 55 to 75 minutes, our ability to maintain deep focus eventually decreases, and we move toward the end of a 90-minute ultradian rhythm.
* we need a break. Phase 3 takes 10-15 minutes.
* this technique is helpful to get going, it’s far from ideal for focusing on challenging “deep work”.
