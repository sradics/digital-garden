# How to provide opinions

[Source](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/adem-mulamustafi%C4%87_meinungsverschiedenheiten-activity-7132623677862350848-y2ed?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

Graham's Hierarchy of Disagreement, also known as the "Graham's Pyramid," is a concept introduced by Paul Graham, an essayist and programmer. It categorizes the various levels of the quality of argument in a disagreement

1. **Name-calling**: This is the lowest level of disagreement and involves attacks on a person rather than addressing the argument or evidence.
2. **Ad Hominem**: At this level, while the attack is on an opponent's characteristics or authority, it's slightly better than name-calling as it might relate to the argument.
3. **Responding to Tone**: Here, the focus shifts to criticizing the tone of the argument rather than the substance of the argument itself.
4. **Contradiction**: This level consists of stating the opposite position without supporting evidence or reasoning.
5. **Counterargument**: Counterargument is higher on the pyramid and involves contradicting with some supporting evidence or reasoning.
6. **Refutation**: This level finds a mistake in an opponent's argument and explains why it's a mistake based on evidence and reasoning.
7. **Refuting the Central Point**: The highest level of disagreement, this involves explicitly refuting the central point of the argument with evidence and logic.
