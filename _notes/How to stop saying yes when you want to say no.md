## Highlights
* If you can't say no, you won't ==find the bandwith to work on what's truly important to you.==
* is ==neither fair to you... nor to the other person==.
* When deciding whether to do something, ==if you feel anything less than “Wow! That would be amazing! Absolutely! Hell yeah!” — then say “no.”==
* Pedro Sorrentino said, “If you ==don’t guard your time, people will steal it== from you.”
* shift your decision-making from reactive to intentional.
* so right now the best way for me to help will be to know what questions you have upfront.
* Try to pick 1-2 that are most important to you, and the more specific the better!
* Might saying no today actually increase your potential for a future hell yeah?
* ==Saying no doesn’t make you a bad person==.
* learning to say no will ==help you say HELL YES to the things you truly want== to do.
