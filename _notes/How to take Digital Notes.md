**Inspiring** - If it is something that is moving you. That is uniquely inspiring for me.
**Useful** - as you can use it as a building block for something later. 
**Easily Lost** For stuff that is easily lost ... and is unlikely that I can find it in future easily
**Personal** - knowledge that I created that is not easy to replicate and also not easy to find on Google


Example - when sending a highly prepared notes with an explanation. Store the content in your notes too. (as it is very likely to be used again)

## Code
### Capture
You capture highlights from eBooks, Articles, Webpages -- sets you apart above 99.5% of people (who are not doing that).

Extract highlights ... you can annotate

Read later apps
* Pocket
* Instapaper

Chrome extension
* liner ... enables highlighting on a page

It is about setting up the last step of saving the capture to your notetaking app.
Getting the information under my control and in my domain.

### Organize
Waiting for having captured enough.
Do the organization later. Start with little concrete parts and get it going

### Distill
It is often just too much we saved (even if it is just the 5% and with high bar for capture).

Summarize the key points of the notes using [[Progressive Summarization]] (highlight, bolding and make it easy to jump around in the notes).

### Express
Share, express, become a creator with your notes.
Creator - bringing something good, beautiful or useful into the world.

It needs a private garden of knowledge. 
Spending to to create timeless information.
