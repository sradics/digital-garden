# How to talk to Anyone - Bib Notes

[Source](https://www.blinkist.com/de/nc/reader/how-to-talk-to-anyone-en)

+ a **==smile==** can make the difference in whether or not you win someone over
+ **==steady eye contact==** to gain respect and affection
+ greet someone the first time like they were an old friend - with a warm smile and body full toward them (indicated undivided attention)
+ **highlight commonalities** you have
+ drop "ums" and **==use empathizers==** instead - like:
	+ "That was the right thing to do"
	+ "I see why you did that"
+ adopt the powerful words ==**we** and **us**== 
	+ convert "What do you think about the new mayor?" to =="How do you think **we'll** do with the new mayor?"==
+ give praise indirectly e.g. by having a third party delivering it
	+ if directly then include it in a casual remark
	+ better to praise immediately
+ enrich your vocabulary
+ **have some relevant quotations handy** (so capture more quotes in Obisidan)
+ have a strong entrance: Before entering, pause at the doorway and give the room a scan.
+ Gestures: adopt and open and inviting posture with your palms facing outward

## Introduction

+ a smooth introduction gets a good conversation going
+ request if from a friend or host
+ have an icebreaker that makes it easy for people to get in contact with you. E.g. A special wearable
+ make **==introductions with including one/two interesting facts==**
+ observe how they are speaking and responding and how their gestures look like ... and do the same (connected with pacing and building rapport)
+ be confident in what you say and engage with a positive attitude
+ **know who in the group has a great story** and give that person a proper introduction

## Small talk

* **prepare for inevitable questions**:
	* Where are you from?
	* What do you do?
* **==embed an interesting fact or anecdote==** in your answer
* be a good listener and put the spotlight on your partner
	* e.g. by repeating the last thing they said (reminds me off active listening and paraphrasing)
* avoid: revealing a secret unless the person is already impressed by you

## In relationships

* be patient and allow them to complain and get out of their system
* **don't leave a conversation hanging**
* sometimes things are best left unsaid
* consider the art of favor
	* don't ask someone to drop everything right now to do you a favor right now
	* don't ask immediately for something in return (reminds me of Give-give-get from  [[Your Network Is Your Net Worth]])
	* be thankful and appreciative

## Sounding professional

+ cut to the chase and **be direct** (connect to time to attention)
+ **==tell the client what you do for them==** (instead of just mentioning your job title)
+ **==reveal commonalities naturally==** embedded in a conversation
+ avoid cliches
+ Instead of asking "What do you do?" **==ask "How do you spend most of your time?"==**
+ separate business and leisure
	+ no business before dessert is finished
	+ on parties - keep is light and make a separate appointment for more serious discussions
+ **be transparent about how you and the client benefit**
+ be the first one to applaud or speak up

## Prepare for meetings

+ **bush up your business jargon**
+ picture yourself smiling, making eye contact and practicing positive body language

## Phone skills

+ instead of nodding do "I'm so happy to hear that", "Please continue"
+ use their name more frequently
+ ask if it is a good time to talk

## Avoid

+ touching your face when you talk - it makes you seem less credible
