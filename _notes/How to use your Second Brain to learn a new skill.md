How My Second Brain Powers My LinkedIn Writing Journey  
(ðŸ§ ðŸ’¡)  
  
I've turned my writing into a systematic pursuit of knowledge, utilizing my Second Brain.  
  
Here's my system:  
â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾  
â†³ Structured Learning: I use the PARA method to organize my writing knowledge, ensuring each lesson builds upon the last.  
â†³ My Map of Content (MOC) serves as a dynamic index, connecting writing concepts for deeper understanding.  
â†³ Integrating Existing Knowledge: I scan my Second Brain to merge new information with existing insights, sparking creativity.  
  
â†³ Streamlined Research: I capture highlights with Matter, transfer them to Obsidian, and import Kindle notes for seamless project integration.  
â†³ Spontaneous Ideation: My digital scratchpad captures fleeting inspiration for unique content ideas.  
â†³ Daily Practice + AI feedback: I apply what I learn with every post and refine drafts using context-aware AI suggestions.  
  
â†³ Writing Library for Reference: I build a comprehensive resource for self-analysis, with each post available in my Second Brain.  
â†³ Tracking Topic Evolution:Â I monitor my content themes over time.  
â†³ Feedback Integration: Audience insights captured in my Second Brain fuel my continuous learning.

## Content preparation
How I grow my writing skills with my Second Brain

I'm currently learning about writing on LinkedIn. On a daily base I use my Second Brain for writing and growing my insights on writing. Here is a brief overview on aspects how I leverage my Second Brain for that: 

+ I have a dedicated project in my PARA structure for Learning about Writing
+ I work with a Map of Content (MOC) as index note to connect several aspects of writing
+ I scanned my Second Brain for references that connect to my topic and grew my MOC with already existing thoughts. With that I follow the approach to connect new learnings with existing knowledge.
+ While exploring the topic through online research I capture to Matter, then read in Matter, Highlight and use the Obsidian plugin to have the notes with highlights automatically created in your Second Brain. I link these captured information in the MOC.
+ When reading books, I prefer reading on Kindle, taking highlights and using the Obsidian Kindle plugin to capture these highlights in Obsidian. Again connect with your MOC
+ I externalize my thoughts while learning. I do this with an extra note in my project, where I just dump sparks and spontaneous thoughts. 
+ I apply my skills daily via writing a post. I create the post in Obsidian and scan for knowledge I can leverage using Smart Connections AI inside my Second Brain. Then I use AI to help me refining my posts, based on my learnings about several aspects for writing, that I provide as context.
+ With that I have all my posts and drafts available in my Second Brain. I can cross reference, recombine and also keep an overview about my topics.
+ I maintain a list of topics to post about in my Todoist task manager. Every time I come across an idea to write about I add it to my list of topics. When something extends that idea, I add a short note to the task
+ With feedback from post engagement, conversations with others I evaluate what is working an tune my approach further. I capture that feedback as an extra note in my project and highlight the key insights and what to try next

[[Bloom's Taxonomy]]
### Remember

- I have worked through many basics of writing, attended courses, noted down essential aspects, and can access them quickly.

### Understand

- I have grasped the concepts of concise writing for short attention spans, understand how carousels, images, and storytelling work. Additionally, I understand the 5 Lightbulbs marketing approach.

### Apply

- I apply writing daily with every new post and each comment. I vary the subject areas I write about and utilize the different formats I have learned.

### Analyze

- I observe how various componentsâ€”text, text structure, image, image with text, carouselsâ€”interact. I analyze the writing and behavior of others. I analyze weekdays and topics.

### Evaluate

- Based on feedback and experiments, I can assess which topics are in demand. I can determine on which weekdays and at what times publishing is sensible.
- I can evaluate different described approaches to see which ones work for me.

### Create

- I combine writing with AI to receive feedback, further optimize sentence structure, and build templates that facilitate the writing process.
- I link writing with additional engagement funnels.
