I am 47, I am made redundant, I am scared

â†’ and it is not yet a happy end story
â†’ It is me, exposing myself. Raw account.
â†’ And I need a tap on my shoulders, please.

What do you do when life throws you a curveball at 47?

It is the first time in my professional career.
I was always employed. Never was I let go.
I worked in many different positions.
Contributed to many top projects.
I'm always learning. I'm moved.

But I'm now NOT WORTH it.

Is that a so called rock bottom?

Considering that I have 4 children.
That I dared to take a high loan.
I take full responsibility!
It is not just me.
It is pressure!

I was in a similar mental state 2x in m life.
That is an advantage! I know the feelings.

And I know what helped me.
â†’ It was TRUSTing in my capabilities.
â†’ I'm equipped with strongest WILLPOWER.
â†’ I can leverage supercharged LEARNING tools.

I'm a (past) software developer. With passion.
I'm an Agile Coach for decades. 15 years!
I'm a product builder & coach.
I'm a systemic coach.
I'm AI First. 

I know what I want. 
Let's build it from here.

This is your Basti(Truman) show.

My ownership, my story! 
I'm ready to move forward.

Scary - sure. Risky - sure. 
Happy end? Not sure yet.

What is ONE advice you would give me?
