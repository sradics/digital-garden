I'm a Librarian type of notetaker, You?  
  
â†’ and I pick the best from all 4 types  
  
[](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAZS4-0Bp9c9yPb6ni-1TIbieOs4XSapDHM)[Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alecunff/) classified four archetypes for taking notes.  
  
The 4 types described briefly (detailed Link in the comments)  
â€”â€”â€”  
Librarian â‡¢ Organizes for easy information retrieval.  
  
Gardener â‡¢ Cultivates ideas and connections.  
  
Student â‡¢ Simple tools for focused learning.  
  
Architect â‡¢ Builds structured note systems.  

Currently, the Librarian is most me.  
  
As a Librarian, I  
  
â†’ Have a practical relationship to info.  
â†’ Save useful, interesting knowledge.  
â†’ Capture varied, eclectic sources.  
  
â†’ Organize for specific purposes.  
â†’ Curate a knowledge collection.  
â†’ Do Project-oriented research.  
  
â†’ Use a Hierarchical system.  
â†’ Serve future self's needs.  
â†’ Avoid content overload.  

And sometimes I'm more of a Gardener  
  
â†’ imagining  
â†’ dreaming  
â†’ wandering  
  
making spontaneous creative connections.  
  
I'm less of an architect nowadays.  
This was different when I started.  
  
Back then:  
  
â†’ I wanted a tight structure for my notes  
â†’ with a clear hierarchy  
â†’ everything in place  
  
I spent too much time of organizing my notes.  
But too little time with actually applying it.  
  
Once I found my system, I relaxed and now I'm a balanced Librarian.  
  
Why does your archetype matter?  
  
â†’ It helps to find your note-taking app  
â†’ It guides how to tune your workflow  
  
Knowing about all 4, also shows me what to integrate next.  
  
What is your preferred archetype?  
(Architect or Gardener or Librarian or Student)
