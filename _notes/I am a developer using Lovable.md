# [[I am a developer using Lovable ]]

## LinkedIn Post

[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_ivebeen-a-developer-now-imusing-lovable-activity-7356645946534858754-U6pJ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAA1M1pkBgWCYPhT45EpfLiHzViQqRWNCIv4)

I'veÂ been a developer, now I'mÂ using Lovable  
  
... and I'mÂ loving it.  
  
If I compare my past development activities (ok, a bit rusty and some years old) to the lightning speed that's now possible... This is fascinating.  
  
Some examples:  
â†’ to implement a complete referral system .. took 10 minutes.  
â†’ to connect payment services .. to 10 minutes (mostly waiting time).  
â†’ to add AI integration including RAG document preparation .. took about 1h  
  
We're talking about building a complete web app in 1-2 days.  
That same app would have taken me several weeks in the past  
(and I'll admit - maybe as a mediocre developer).  
  
But here's what really excites me:  
â€”â€”â€”  
From idea to implementation: 2 days.  
The experimentation speed is game-changing.  
  
You can get insights faster. Try things immediately.  
Make concepts tangible before they lose momentum.  
  
And I bet this completely flips the script for user research too.  
Instead of spending weeks building to test an assumption, you can validate ideas in days.  
  
What's your experience with these rapid app development capabilities?  
Are you seeing similar speed gains in your projects?  
  
P.S. Still can't believe that referral system took 10 minutes. The future of development is wild.
