Have you ever felt like your own worst critic? Discover a mindset shift that transforms  
(that is based on making PRAISE familiar and criticism unfamiliar)  
  
A heartfelt thank you to [Katharina Loth ðŸš€](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katharina-loth/) for introducing me to a transformative mindset shift. ðŸŒŸ You introduced me to the teachings of [Marisa Peer](https://www.linkedin.com/company/marisa-peer/), and her insights have been with high impact for me.Â Her concept is simple yet profound:Â Praise should be a familiar presence in our lives, while criticism should be a stranger.Â (find the link to her inspiring talk in the comments below.)  
  
The essence of Marisa's approach is toÂ communicate with our own mindsâ€”to give ourselves direct, unambiguous commands that lead to positive outcomes and eliminate any chance of misunderstanding. It's about nurturing the narrative we tell ourselves.  
It is based on TELLING MY BRAIN THAT I WANT TO DO THAT. Combined with stopping me to say HARSH, CRITICAL, HURTFUL words to myself.  
  
And I lie, cheat and steal to my brain to implant that new me, that new behavior. As a playful way to trick my brain into embracing a new, more constructive self-perception.  
  
The cornerstone of this transformative process is three powerful words:  
I AM ENOUGH expanded with  
  
I AM SO ENOUGH  
  
It is UNBELIEVABLE HOW ENOUGH I AM  
  
When I first watched Marisa Peer's video, I was deeply moved, especially when she discussed the desire for parental approval. It highlighted my need for self-work and connected with a powerful anchor a coach once gave me: It was the picture of my beloved great-grandfather tapping me on my shoulders and telling me that I can do that, that I am a good person, that I AM ENOUGH.  
  
I've taken this to heart, making "I AM ENOUGH" the wallpaper on my phone, confronting me with this empowering affirmation numerous times a day. I recite it, reinforcing my self-worth and tapping into a wellspring of inner strength. It's a reminder of my capabilities and the untapped resources within me.  
  
Drawing inspiration from David Goggins' teachings about stepping out of our comfort zones, I connect the act of stretching myself with the affirmative self-talk:  
"I HAVE CHOSEN TO DO THIS, I FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT IT, and I AM ENOUGH!"  
  
So today, I extend an invitation for a simple, yet powerful exercise. Close your eyes, speak these words out loud to yourself:  
  
I AM ENOUGH, I AM SO ENOUGH, it is UNBELIEVABLE HOW ENOUGH I AM  
  
Notice the emotions that arise. Let this be the start of a new conversation with yourselfâ€”one that is filled with kindness, affirmation, and the belief in your boundless potential.  
  
ðŸ‘‰ Share how affirming 'I AM ENOUGH' changes your day

## Content preparation
Thank you Katharina Loth for mentioning this life changing concept to me
(based on making PRAISE familiar and critisism unfamiliar)

The approach is from Marisa Peer (link to her impactful talk in the comments). It deeply touched me and changed my life. It is based on TELLING MY BRAIN THAT I WANT TO DO THAT. Combined with stopping me to say HARSH, CRITICAL, HURTFUL words to myself.

It is programming myself expressed in direct, clear, specific, detailed, crystal clear commands and instructions that signal and communicate to my mind in a way that gives me great results with no misinterpretation.

And I LIE, CHEAT and STEAL to my brain to implant that new me, that new behavior.

All based on the powerful and fundamental 3 simple words:

I AM ENOUGH       extended with
I AM SO ENOUGH
It is UNBELIEVABLE HOW ENOUGH I AM

I AM ENOUGH is guiding me everywhere. I made it my phone screen background and I'm facing it now very often a day. I keep repeating that several times a day. And it provided me immense strength. A power to use my capabilities and to tap into my resources. Combined with the learnings from David Goggins about what is possible when I step out of my comfort zone and clearly connect this stretch with telling myself - I HAVE CHOSEN TO DO THIS, I FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT THAT and I AM ENOUGH!

So today I'd like to ask your for one simple action. Close your eyes and say to yourself loud and clearly. I AM ENOUGH, I AM SO ENOUGH, it is UNBELIEVABLE HOW ENOUGH I AM and observe your emotions.
