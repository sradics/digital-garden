I built 3 apps this week. Without writing code.  
  
â†’ This is what "vibe coding" with AI looks like  
  
AI environments like Lovable and Cursor are turning ideas into working applications in hours, not months.  
  
The shift I'm seeing:  
â†’ From "I need to learn to code" to  
"I need to learn to communicate with AI"  
  
â†’ From months of development to weekend prototypes  
  
The video shows highlights from my vibe coding session earlier this week. 
(Full session: [https://lnkd.in/ed6M39s6](https://lnkd.in/ed6M39s6))  
  
The barrier between "I have an idea" and "I have an app" just got a lot smaller.  
  
Now ... maybe an inspiration for today:  
What would you build if coding wasn't the bottleneck?  
  
Try this: Stop scrolling, head over to Lovable, build your first small app in 10 minutes. 
(like I did with this small quiz - [https://lnkd.in/e857vGVk](https://lnkd.in/e857vGVk))  
  
P.S.  
DM me if you want guidance getting started.  
Happy to share what I've learned.
