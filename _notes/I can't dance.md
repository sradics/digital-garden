  I can't dance, I can't sing

â†’ I'm just standing here learning everything
â†’ Phil Collins: I can't dance (remember?)
â†’ Alexa: Play I can't dance by Genesis

I remember still today
It was a sunny, early morning.
I was 11 years old, and on school holidays
My father loved the music from Phil Collins
So I got inspired too. But it was in English
And I wanted to understand the lyrics
I started English to German with
The song "I can't dance"

Back then â¤º
(young readers might think of stone age)
â†’ no auto translate
â†’ no Internet to ask for
â†’ just a EN to German dictionary

There I was
Translating word by word
Starting with the title "I can't dance"
I was primed by my interpretation and
I misinterpreted it. It became a SAD song

Years later, when I saw the music video
I laughed about myself. I was so off
It is a playful,humorous song!

âž  I learned: Context matters

Looking back, I realise:
â†’ Learning is now so much more enabled
â†’ I can access to the lyrics in seconds
â†’ I can watch and listen immediately
â†’ I can ask for interpretation 
â†’ I use auto translation

Do I still need a paper dictionary?

â†’ You can learn much faster and with impact
âž  When you upgrade your approach 
âž  and  leverage advanced tools

When did you last change how you learn?
Want inspiration > Type SMART in the comments
