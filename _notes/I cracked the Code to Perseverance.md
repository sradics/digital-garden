# [[I cracked the Code to Perseverance]]
## LinkedIn Post
[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_turn-your-routines-to-powerful-rituals-activity-7184809157126950912-ODPG?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

I cracked the code to perseverance (after years of failing)  
  
(and hit a 140-week exercise streak)  
  
We all know the struggle – starting strong, then fizzling out.  
And aiming for building a habit won’t work here.  
For exercises I always need to invest willpower and energy.  
  
So instead of relying on habit formation,  
the key is that I turned my routines into rituals.  
By getting conscious about your WHY behind your routines.  
  
I was inspired by books like "The Why Cafe" and "Outlive," and longevity became my driving purpose. (actually there is another purpose behind longevity, that I might expose in future too)  
  
Knowing my WHY gives me the drive for daily 100-minute workouts.  
My exercise routine became a daily ritual.  
And as a result I've maintained a 140-week streak  
of 5+ intense workouts a week.

Hook:
I found my key to perseverance and a 140 weeks streak
(How you turn it into rituals)

One person:
My self forming rituals and not longer giving up on my exercises.

One Problem: 
We start strong with a routine, but get lost along the way because we did not yet connect a purpose with the routines. 
When I need to invest willingness and energy to a routine, I cannot rely on forming a habit. It will never get automated and subconscious.

One Solution:
Instead you should transform your routines to rituals by getting conscious about your WHY behind your routines.

One Story:
Doing my daily exercises with perseverance is a challenge that needs high willingness. In my past I had several bursts of doing exercises, but I gave up even after some months of intense workouts. 

Everything changed when I found and connected my bigger purpose. I found it through inspirations from Cafe at the end of the world, combined with the Big 5 for life. Later on Longevity sharpened my mind. 

My bigger purpose behind exercises is longevity. And longevity is connected with my reason to exist, that is ... (maybe exposed when I feel comfortable sharing that publicly). 

Knowing about that connection provides me a high level of motivation every day to go through my 100 minutes exercise ritual. And I'm on my 140 weeks (soon 3 years) streak of at least 5x intense and purposeful exercises per week.

For finding your purpose and building your rituals maybe you find your inspiration through:

📖 Outlive by Peter Attia
📖 Start With Why and Find Your why by Simon Sinek
