I discovered my writing voice in the most unexpected place.  
â†’ Buried in 270,000 words of my own recorded conversations.  
  
My challenge:  
Writing clearly as a non-native English speaker while staying authentic  
  
My aha-moment:  
Analyzing my natural speaking patterns from course recordings  
  
One result: "Lexicon"  
My personalized AI writing mentor  
  
Here's my 4-step process to build such a writing-mentor/coach/editor:  
â†’ Gather deep knowledge (created 10,000-word writing knowledge base) â†’ Extract your natural voice (fed AI my conversation transcripts)  
â†’ Combine both insights into a custom AI assistant  
â†’ Use it for continuous feedback and improvement
