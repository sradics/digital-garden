I want you to progress in your career

â†’ But I'm not a magician
â†’ I believe in putting in the work
â†’ Proofing again and again it's YOU next

Over 23 years, I've evolved through diverse and exciting roles.

â†’ I started as a Software Developer 
But I sought greater impact in team collaboration.

â†’ I transformed workplaces as Agile coach
But I wanted management roles for decision-making power.

â†’ I lead teams of engineers and coaches
But I wanted to solve customer problems directly.

â†’ I coached product teams to drive Product Discovery
While working on the topic of Learning

Throughout these career steps,  3 factors stood out:

âž  Anticipation of what was needed.

âž  My willingness to learn into a new field

âž  My increasing speed and impact of learning

To take that next step in your career, 
You know the next steps required.
Right!?
