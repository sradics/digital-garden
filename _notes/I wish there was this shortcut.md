I found the secret to overnight success.  
  
â†’ It only took 7 years...  
  
I've been lured by the promise of 'quick and easy' solutions many times.  
  
â†’ Lost (a lot) in the lottery with stocks - aiming for the fast money  
â†’ Went for the Bitcoin, just to be eaten by whales  
â†’ Bought the quick fix solution promise  
  
Just to invest 10x the time, money, energy fixing it afterward  
  
These expensive lessons taught me one crucial truth:  
  
âž  Mainly, there is no quick fix.  
  
So what works instead?  
  
It is about staying on a path, day after day and the willingness to persist despite challenges.  
  
Before dismissing this as obvious advice, consider this:  
When we look at the quick fix promises, we don't see:  
  
â†’ The different starting points  
â†’ The years of effort to reach that stage (from the promise holder)  
â†’ The survivor bias - hiding all the examples of failed journeys  
  
This applies especially to learning and becoming knowledgeable.  
  
I would be a fool to promise you that you can upgrade your learning just overnight.  
  
It took me years to reach my current level of working with knowledge.  
  
But here's the good news:  
You can take the smarter route to learning.  
  
It is about discarding approaches that don't work.  
  
This means to unlearn things like:  
â€”â€”  
â†’ Trying to store everything in our brains.  
â†’ Too much focus on either Why, How, What, Vision  
â†’ Capturing (consuming) information without making it stick  
  
Now, here's what works instead:  
â€”â€”  
â†’ To leverage tools/ approaches that connect to David Allen's claim:  
"Your brain is for having ideas, not for storing them"  
  
Concrete: Implement a Second Brain approach  

â†’ Learn holistically and integrate Why-What-How-What if  
  
Concrete: Work with the 4MAT learning cycle  

â†’ Get into the Power Mode and follow:  
  
KNOWLEGDE x ACTION = POWER  
  
Concrete: Apply the learnings.  
â‡¢ Express via your writings  
â‡¢ Use your learning in a concrete project  
â‡¢ Collaborate and teach others with your insights  

For all 3, you can take the fast lane and learn from an expert.  
But no empty promise here - it will still take you effort and time to level up.  
  
But by avoiding common mistakes, you can save time on your learning path.  
  
Would you learn to play tennis without a trainer?  
Really ... think twice.

P.S.  
I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease
