4 unexpected benefits of LinkedIn's most controversial tool  
  
â†’ From 0 to daily engagement: My controversial path  
  
I started with writing posts daily.  
For about 6 months, with very little traction.  
  
Then I learned something invaluable from the great Brand Built community: ENGAGEMENT matters.  
  
From day one applying this advice,  
I noticed a real shift in how people engaged with my content.  
  
But then I discovered another game-changer.  
A system of support.  
  
And hereâ€™s where it gets tricky.  
  
Because I know, maybe I shouldnâ€™t say this word too loud.  
The word that some say puts your work in a bad light.  
The word that people use to put you in a box.  
  
The "Voldemort" word.  
  
POD  
  
Yes, I said it!  
  
What â€”â€” a pod? Really? Why?  
Well I admit, I'm a Podster.  

â€”â€”â€”Â Wait, actually what is a LinkedIn-Pod? â€”â€”â€”  
  
It is a group of people who support each other daily with their LinkedIn reach.  
Often through mutual engagement.  
  
Also extended with helping each other with content strategies and LinkedIn approaches.  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
Now that you know what a POD is, let me share why I believe they're valuable:  
4 reasons why I work in a POD  
  
â†’ Increased Accountability (1)  
It creates a high accountability to stay consistent with content and with engagement. No excuses - contribute or leave.  
  
â†’ A growth system (2)  
I learn daily a lot from my peers awesome contributions.  
The way they format, they way they create content.  
  
So much to explore and "steal" like a monkey.  
Well - even with permission.  
  
â†’ Experts with a shared common goal (3)  
â‡¢ Where I can ask questions  
â‡¢ Where we help each other  
â‡¢ Aligned with a common purpose  
  
Think of it as an organized network.  
Rather than randomly detecting great contributions. Rather than rely on the LinkedIn algorithm. I get strong input on several interesting aspects every day.  
  
With reduced cognitive load to search.  

â†’ Strengthening relations (4)  
I observe the strong connections that form over time.  
  
Supporting each other over months. Getting to know each other through the writing, through the topic and through questions and struggles.... this creates a community experience.  
  
â†’ BONUS - A Powerful Benefit (5)  
Being engaged in a POD increases visibility of own messages.  
  
Either through POD members themselves and through their network that get activated when they engage with my content and vice versa.  
  
The impact is measurable.  
And I'll soon also share some more stats.  
  
âž  PODs aren't just about gaming the system -  
they're legitimate communities for growth and mutual support  
  
On to learn and growth together!  
  
What is ONE immediate thought that comes to mind?  

â€”â€”â€”  
P.S.  
I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease
