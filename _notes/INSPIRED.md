## Highlights
Who decides what products we should build? How do they decide? How do they know that what we build will be useful? — location: [614](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=614) ^ref-27519

Product teams complain that they don't understand the big picture—they don't see how their work contributes to the larger goals, — location: [726](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=726) ^ref-53112

---
Not just tweaking and optimizing existing products (referred to as value capture) — location: [745](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=745) ^ref-27315

---
rather, developing each product to reach its full potential. — location: [745](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=745) ^ref-8814

the lack of innovation, and how much slower it is for new product work to get into the hands of customers. — location: [757](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=757) ^ref-61620

---
cases, and some are informal, but either way it boils down to the need to know two things about each idea: (1) How much money or value will it make? and (2) How much money or time will it cost? — location: [789](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=789) ^ref-62617

doing business cases, at least for ideas that need a larger investment. — location: [824](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=824) ^ref-28435

---
Well, the cold, hard truth is that, at this stage, we have no clue about either of these. In fact, we can't know. — location: [826](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=826) ^ref-60199

---
The truth, however, is that many product ideas end up making absolutely nothing. — location: [829](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=829) ^ref-26034

---
The first truth is that at least half of our ideas are just not going to work. — location: [843](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=843) ^ref-27706

---
The most common is that customers just aren't as excited about this idea as we are. — location: [846](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=846) ^ref-54586

---
(By the way, the really good teams assume that at least three quarters of the ideas won't perform like they hope.) — location: [851](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=851) ^ref-43291

---
typically takes several iterations to get the implementation of this idea to the point where it delivers the necessary business value. — location: [853](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=853) ^ref-15788

---
it's really a form of project management. In this model, it's more about gathering requirements and documenting them for engineers. — location: [858](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=858) ^ref-13149

and mostly what's being done is what we call the “lipstick on the pig” model. — location: [862](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=862) ^ref-15608

The little secret in product is that engineers are typically the best single source of innovation; — location: [866](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=866) ^ref-1768

What you're really seeing is Agile for delivery, but the rest of the organization and context is anything but Agile. — location: [869](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=869) ^ref-30392

Unfortunately, projects are output and product is all about outcome. — location: [872](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=872) ^ref-61670

that all the risk is at the end, which means that customer validation happens way too late. — location: [875](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=875) ^ref-45877

of waste is to design, build, test, and deploy a feature or product only to find out it is not what was needed. — location: [877](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=877) ^ref-28310

they've spent substantial time and money—hardly in the spirit of Lean. Or they go way overboard and think they have to test and validate everything, so they go nowhere fast. — location: [901](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=901) ^ref-16727

---
Risks are tackled up front, rather than at the end. In modern teams, we tackle these risks prior to deciding to build anything. — location: [909](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=909) ^ref-56592

and business viability risk (whether this solution also works for the various aspects of our business—sales, marketing, finance, legal, etc.). — location: [913](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=913) ^ref-36137

---
Products are defined and designed collaboratively, rather than sequentially. — location: [914](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=914) ^ref-18693

---
In strong teams, product, design, and engineering work side by side, in a give‐and‐take way, to come up with technology‐powered solutions that our customers love and that work for our business. — location: [917](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=917) ^ref-52291

Finally, it's all about solving problems, not implementing — location: [919](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=919) ^ref-7111

They must ensure that solution solves the underlying problem. It's about business results. — location: [920](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=920) ^ref-29280

---
This certainly includes the functionality—the features. But it also includes the technology that enables this functionality. It also includes the user experience design that presents this functionality. And it includes how we monetize this functionality. It includes how we attract and acquire users and customers. And it can also include offline experiences as well that are essential to delivering the product's value. — location: [931](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=931) ^ref-36981

---
We are always working in parallel to both discover the necessary product to be built—which is primarily what the product manager and designer work on every day—while the engineers work to deliver production‐quality product. — location: [956](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=956) ^ref-7993

---
In discovery, we are tackling the various risks before we write even one line of production software. — location: [966](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=966) ^ref-1950

---
The purpose of product discovery is to quickly separate the good ideas from the bad. — location: [967](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=967) ^ref-5420

---
output of product discovery is a validated product backlog. — location: [967](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=967) ^ref-8290

---
Will the user buy this (or choose to use it)? Can the user figure out how to use this? Can our engineers build this? Can our stakeholders support this? — location: [970](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=970) ^ref-48618

---
involves running a series of very quick experiments, and to do these experiments quickly and inexpensively, we use prototypes rather than products. — location: [974](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=974) ^ref-32737

---
To set your expectations, strong teams normally test many product ideas each week—on the order of 10 to 20 or more per week. — location: [978](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=978) ^ref-55917

with something that provides some evidence it is worth building and that we can then deliver to our customers. — location: [986](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=986) ^ref-1818

This means the necessary scale, performance, reliability, fault tolerance, security, privacy, internationalization, and localization have been performed, and the product works as advertised. — location: [987](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=987) ^ref-46672

product vision. This refers to the longer‐term objective of this product, normally 2–10 years out. — location: [1001](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1001) ^ref-6231

is how we as a product organization intend to deliver on the company's mission. — location: [1002](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1002) ^ref-36413

---
So, we use prototypes to conduct rapid experiments in product discovery, and then in delivery, we build and release products in hopes of achieving product/market fit, which is a key step on the way to delivering on the company's product vision. — location: [1003](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1003) ^ref-43532

The MVP should be a prototype, not a product. — location: [1026](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1026) ^ref-24670

---
Building an actual product‐quality deliverable to learn, even if that deliverable has minimal functionality, leads to substantial waste of time and money, which of course is the antithesis of Lean. — location: [1027](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1027) ^ref-32476

Good teams get their inspiration and product ideas from their vision and objectives, from observing customers' struggle, from analyzing the data customers generate from using their product, and from constantly seeking to apply new technology to solve real problems.

Good teams understand who each of their key stakeholders are, they understand the constraints that these stakeholders operate in, and they are committed to inventing solutions that work not just for users and customers, but also work within the constraints of the business. Bad teams gather requirements from stakeholders. Good teams are skilled in the many techniques to rapidly try out product ideas to determine which ones are truly worth building. Bad teams hold meetings to generate prioritized roadmaps. Good teams love to have brainstorming discussions with smart thought leaders from across the company. Bad teams get offended when someone outside their team dares to suggest they do something. — location: [4990](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4990) ^ref-40274

Good teams have product, design, and engineering sit side by side, and they embrace the give and take between the functionality, the user experience, and the enabling technology. Bad teams sit in their respective silos, and ask that others make requests for their services in the form of documents and scheduling meetings.

Good teams ensure that their engineers have time to try out the prototypes in discovery every day so that they can contribute their thoughts on how to make the product better. Bad teams show the prototypes to the engineers during sprint planning so they can estimate. Good teams engage directly with end users and customers every week, to better understand their customers, and to see the customer's response to their latest ideas.
