Unless the organization takes a comprehensive and systematic approach to protecting the availability, integrity and confidentiality of its information, it will be vulnerable to a wide range of possible threats. — location: [432](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07YDZ52KS&location=432) ^ref-11093

Good information security management is about organizations understanding the risks and threats they face and the vulnerabilities in their current computer processing facilities. It is about putting in place common-sense procedures to minimize the risks and about educating all the employees about their responsibilities. Most importantly, it is about ensuring that the policy on information security management has the commitment of senior managers. — location: [474](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07YDZ52KS&location=474) ^ref-3065

The various components of that financial loss include discovery, investigation, response, remediation, customer notification costs, legal fees, regulatory breach notification costs, and increased operational, marketing and PR costs. — location: [496](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07YDZ52KS&location=496) ^ref-44982

---
No organization is immune. Every organization, at some time, will suffer one or more of the disruptions, abuses or attacks identified in these pages. Businesses will be disrupted. Downtime in business-critical systems such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems can be catastrophic for an organization. However quickly service is restored, there will be an unwanted and unnecessary cost — location: [594](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07YDZ52KS&location=594) ^ref-17171

in doing so. At other times, lost data may have to be painstakingly reconstructed and sometimes will be lost forever. Privacy will be violated. Organizations have to protect the personal information of employees and customers. If this privacy is violated, there may be legal action and penalties. Organizations will continue suffering direct financial loss. Protection in particular of commercial information and customers’ credit card details is essential. — location: [597](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07YDZ52KS&location=597) ^ref-42967

---
Loss or theft of commercial information, ranging from business plans and customer contracts to intellectual property and product designs, and industrial know-how, can all cause long-term financial damage to the victim organization. Computer fraud, conducted by staff with or without third-party involvement, has an immediate direct financial impact. — location: [601](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07YDZ52KS&location=601) ^ref-16126

---
Regulators will increasingly legislate to force corporations to take appropriate information security action and that will drive up the cost and complexity of information security. Breaches will increasingly also trigger mandatory reporting requirements and — location: [604](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07YDZ52KS&location=604) ^ref-27387

---
lead to significant fines. Reputations will be damaged. Organizations that are unable to protect the privacy of information about staff and customers, and which consequently attract penalties and fines, will find their corporate credibility and business relationships severely damaged and their expensively developed brand and brand image dented. — location: [606](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07YDZ52KS&location=606) ^ref-25927

the existence of a risk-based information security policy, implemented through an ISMS, is clear evidence that the organization has taken the necessary and appropriate steps. — location: [637](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07YDZ52KS&location=637) ^ref-9804

The directors of the organization will be able to demonstrate that they are complying with the relevant requirements of Sarbanes–Oxley, Basel 2/3, the FRC’s Risk Guidance or with current international best practice in risk management with regard to information assets and security. The organization will be able to demonstrate, in the context of the array of relevant legislation, that it has taken appropriate compliance action, particularly with data protection legislation such as the GDPR. The organization will be able systematically to protect itself from the dangers and potential costs of computer misuse, cybercrime and the impacts of cyberwar. — location: [642](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07YDZ52KS&location=642) ^ref-55132

The organization will be able to improve its credibility with staff, customers and partner organizations, and this improved credibility can have direct financial benefits through, for instance, improved sales. This competitive requirement is increasingly becoming a critical factor for organizations in winning new business from clients that are aware of the need for their suppliers to demonstrate they have implemented effective information security management measures. — location: [647](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07YDZ52KS&location=647) ^ref-18116

Are the significant internal and external operational, financial, compliance and other risks identified and assessed on an ongoing basis? (Significant risks may, for example, include those related to market, credit, liquidity, technological, legal, health, safety and environmental, reputation and business probity issues.) Does the board have clear strategies for dealing with the significant risks that have been identified? Is there a policy on how to manage these risks? Are information needs and related information systems reassessed as objectives and related risks change, or as reporting deficiencies are identified? Are there specific arrangements for management monitoring and reporting to the board on risk and control matters of particular importance? These could include, for example, actual or suspected fraud and other illegal or irregular acts, or matters that could adversely affect the company’s reputation or financial position. — location: [742](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07YDZ52KS&location=742) ^ref-47441

certificate tells existing and potential customers that the organization has defined and put in place effective information security processes, thus helping create a trusting relationship. A certification process also helps the organization focus on continuously improving its information security processes.

Create the management framework: set up your implementation project, define the internal and external context of the organization, identify the requirements of any interested parties and, considering these issues, define the scope of the ISMS; select a continual improvement model and determine your approach to documentation. — location: [1068](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07YDZ52KS&location=1068) ^ref-45754

Define a systematic approach to information security risk assessment and the risk acceptance criteria. — location: [1072](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07YDZ52KS&location=1072) ^ref-49627

---
Carry out a risk assessment to identify, within the context of the policy and ISMS scope, the important information assets of the organization and the risks to them. This is where you assess the risks. — location: [1073](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07YDZ52KS&location=1073) ^ref-61853

Identify and evaluate options for the treatment of these risks, selecting, where required, the control objectives and controls to be implemented. Prepare a statement of applicability and a risk treatment plan. — location: [1074](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07YDZ52KS&location=1074) ^ref-14610

The implementation process will go through its own five steps: Finalize the risk treatment plan and its documentation, including planned processes and any required supporting documentation. Implement the risk treatment plan and planned controls. Arrange appropriate training for affected staff, as well as awareness programmes.

Risk assessment is a systematic study of the probability and consequences of events, or, alternatively, the systematic and methodical consideration of: 1) the business harm likely — location: [1923](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07YDZ52KS&location=1923) ^ref-47604

Risk treatment (which, with risk assessment, makes up the two stages of risk management) might involve the selection of controls in order to reduce risk to an acceptable level. — location: [1925](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07YDZ52KS&location=1925) ^ref-6646
