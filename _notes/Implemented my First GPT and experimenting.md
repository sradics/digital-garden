## Content preparation
I externalized my growing knowledge on writing in a GPT and now have an assistent for my daily LinkedIn posts. Thanks to  all my data prepared in my Second Brain it was super smooth to feed the briefing data to the GPT. 

Steps:
+ I did export my insights about writing as a Pdf. 
+ Based on a distilled version of Magnetic Writing Tips (see comments)
+ and my insights from Tired of writing no one wants to read: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_on-writing-activity-7167443208279437313-Bs-d?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop
+ combined with a briefing on writing hook headlines I learned from Farouk Bacha: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/faroukbacha_lara-acosta-linkedin-hook-strategy-activity-7176193307088171008-YgmF?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop and with 12 t

First impressions:
+ It saves time as I don't have to provide my instructions again and again or copy prompts
+ The initial quality of my refined posts is great to build on
+ I'm looking forward to a bigger context window, where I can really build on all my previous posts.
