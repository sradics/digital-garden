## Content preparation
I externalized my growing knowledge on writing in a GPT and now have an assistent for my daily LinkedIn posts. Thanks to  all my data prepared in my Second Brain it was super smooth to feed the briefing data to the GPT. 

Steps:
+ I did export my insights about writing as a Pdf. 
+ Based on a distilled version of Magnetic Writing Tips (see comments)
+ and my insights from Tired of writing no one wants to read: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_on-writing-activity-7167443208279437313-Bs-d?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop
+ combined with a briefing on writing hook headlines I learned from Farouk Bacha: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/faroukbacha_lara-acosta-linkedin-hook-strategy-activity-7176193307088171008-YgmF?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop and with 12 tips for writing headlines from Lara Acosta
+ I did export all my LinkedIn posts in one big Pdf. GPT provided me with a python script to extract that information from my Second Brain and create that combined Pdf. This became my knowledge base for the GPT 
+ And I extracted all my post headlines so far and provided that too

First impressions:
+ I can now learn more about my writing behavior. Some simple prompts I experimented with:

Based on my headlines what are topics I'm writing about and how often do I write about it?

List all books recommendations I provided so far

What are main insights I shared about productivity and tools. Especially when it comes to smart learning and AI. Please list at least 20 hints.

Based in my topics so far, what might be next topics I should write about? Please provide me 30 more content ideas

+ It saves time as I don't have to provide my instructions again and again
+ The initial quality of my refined posts is great to build on
+ I'm looking forward to a bigger context window, where I can really build on all my previous posts. 

What I want to learn next:
+ How to best keep the GPT up-2-date and tune it with new knowledge and my growing posts knowledge base
+ How can I increase the context window, so that the GPT can leverage all my insights
+ I need to better organize my posts metadata to e.g. easily extract all headlines. I will use the LinkedIn API for that soon

In summary - I can highly recommend playing with building your own GPT. It leads to higher efficiency and leverages compounding knowledge.
