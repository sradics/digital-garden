Your Traditional Learning Methods Are Costing You Time  
â†’ The AI wake-up call that changed how I learn forever  
  
Welcome to Edition 004, focused on Learning with AI.  
  
What can I say? AI has reshaped my approach to learning entirely!  
  
AI-enhanced learning isn't optional anymore â€“ it's your professional superpower.  
  
In Edition 004, discover how to:  
â†’ Use AI for information capture  
â†’ Integrate AI with knowledge for better retrieval and connectivity  
â†’ Combine AI with the 4MAT learning cycle for holistic learning  
â†’ Understand when to use AI and when NOT (yet)  
  
Let me close with three key recommendations for AI and learning:  
1) Adopt an AI First mindset (thinking of pioneer Felix here)  
2) Assume current AI is the "worst" you'll use  
3) Remain the "human in the loop"
