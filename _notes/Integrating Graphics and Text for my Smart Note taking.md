# Integrating Graphics and Text for my Smart Note taking

I currently rely a lot on text only and do not leverage my Remarkable and also not Obsidian Excalidraw. 

For Excalidraw it is likely that I don't yet know how to get these graphics to my digital garden (likely I need to expert in a static format...). 

For Remarkable it is just not yet in my behaviour to think about that.

As [[e-Learning and the Science of Instruction - Ruth C Clark Richard E Mayer]] suggests connecting text and graphics play and important role in learning (p71) I need to look at this more.
