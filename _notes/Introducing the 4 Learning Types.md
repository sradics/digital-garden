# [[Introducing the 4 Learning Types]]
## LinkedIn Post
[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_im-definitely-a-what-learner-and-you-exploring-activity-7188431478718889984-fYFp?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

I'm definitely a WHAT learner and You?  
(exploring 4MAT)  
  
Ditching the VARK model and exploring the powerful 4MAT system.  
4MAT focuses on how we both perceive and process information:  
  
ü¶ãWHY Learners: Motivated by personal connections and meaning.  
through feeling/experiencing + watching/reflecting  
  
üî¢ WHAT Learners: Love facts, theories, and logic.  
through thinking/conceptualizing + watching/reflecting  
  
üèÉüèªHOW Learners: Learn best through hands-on application.  
through thinking/conceptualizing + doing/acting  
  
ü™ûIF Learners: Benefit from social interactions and discussions.  
through feeling/experiencing + doing/acting  
  
I identify most as a WHAT Learner, keen on understanding theories before practical application.  
  
However, embracing all four styles is crucial for a holistic learning experience.  
Ensuring a full cycle of engagement‚Äîfrom conceptualization to practical implementation.  
  
While we may favor one style,  
integrating all four‚Äîfeeling, thinking, doing, and interacting  
provides enhanced understanding and retention.  
  
Which style resonates with you?  
How do you blend the other styles into your learning?  
  
Next - I‚Äôll explore how a Second Brain amplifies our learning efficiency by aligning with our preferred styles.

## Content preparation
I'm a WHAT learner and You?
(exploring 4MAT)

Knowing about my own learning type and also looking at learning types in general helps to adjust my approach to learning. Long time I thought about the often mentioned VARK - visual - aural - read/write - kinesthetic learning types but this got disproved by several studies.

Then I discovered a classification that has much more evidence and that I can connect too better. The 4MAT model is build on how we perceive and how we process information and distinguishes:

+ WHY Learner - through feeling/experiencing + watching/reflecting
Need a clear reason and learn best through emotional stories and practical examples.

+ WHAT Learner - through thinking/conceptualizing + watching/reflecting
Prefer logic, statistics, studies and evidence and to understand correlations

+ HOW Learner - through thinking/conceptualizing + doing/acting
Learn best through direct experiments and practical application. Doing and solving problems are key to success.

+ IF Learner - through feeling/experiencing + doing/acting
Prefer social exchange and discussions to reflect learnings and explore potential applications.

I mentions that we have preferred types and at the same time that it is important to consider the learning cycles that combines all 4. 

I'm a WHAT Learner. I love to first read about a topic. Understand correlations. Look for evidence. And like logical conclusions. 
Just after that stage I get into practical applications, connect to my Why (sometimes I even skip that) and socialize the learning. 

What is your first intuition about the 4 types? Which one resonates the most with you?

In next posts I'll connect Second Brain and learning types and explore how different approaches with the Second Brain leverage our preferred learning type.
