## Highlights
* Quiet Quitting movement raises three much juicier questions. We call these needle-moving questions, $10K Questions.
	* ==What are you expecting work to provide you?== 
	* ==Do you know how to set boundaries?== 
	* ==Where does your self-worth come from?==
* a ==job acts as a “container” for the following human needs==:
	* **Identity and status**
	* **Flexibility** 
	* **Craftsmanship** 
	* **Impact and meaning**
	* **Learning** 
	* **Socialization**
* the first $10K Question is, ==“Which of these matter to me?”==
* Quiet Quitters have figured out how to set boundaries.
* But here’s another $10K Question: ==What IS WORTH going the extra mile for?==
