Your knowledge compounds like money  
  
â†’ But this wealth can't be stolen  
  
"Mastery ... the mysterious process during which what is at first difficult becomes progressively easier and more pleasurable through practice."  
  
I'm on my path to mastery for the topic of Learning how to learn.  
  
Mastering how to learn unlocks an exponential growth curve:  
âž  Each skill builds upon the last  
âž  I experience the effect of compounding knowledge.  
  
Do you want to fast follow?  
These four strategies can guide your path to compounding knowledge too:  
  
â†’ Follow your interests  
â†’ Discover the joy of being in the journey  
â†’ Build systems that empower your daily learning  
â†’ Leverage the 1%-Method and power of small steps
