# [[It is not VARK]]
## LinkedIn Post
[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_the-learning-style-lie-i-believed-i-even-activity-7282652292191850496-2ZEa?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

 The learning style lie I believed  
  
(I even avoided podcasts for years because of this)  
  
For years, I followed the VARK myth:  
Visual, Auditory, Reading, Kinesthetic learning preferences.  
  
I labeled myself a "Reading/Writing learner."  
I even avoided podcasts and audiobooks.  
(Big mistake!)  
  
According to research, there's no credible evidence supporting VARK learning styles.

â€”â€”â€” END OF AD â€”â€”â€” (did you skip successfully?)  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
[Perplexity.ai](http://perplexity.ai/):  
Despite its popularity in educational settings,  
there is no credible evidence supporting the effectiveness of matching teaching methods to VARK learning styles.  
â€”â€”â€”  

So I dug deeper and discovered something better.  
  
These four learning styles match reality much better:  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
â†’ Innovative/Imaginative Learners:  
Focus on personal meaning and connections, asking "Why?"  
  
â†’ Analytic Learners:  
Seek facts and conceptual understanding, asking "What?"  
  
â†’ Common Sense Learners:  
Prefer hands-on experiences and practical applications, asking "How?"  
  
â†’ Dynamic Learners:  
Enjoy self-discovery and exploring possibilities, asking "If?"  
  
Check out:

â†’ "I discovered why my coworker drove me crazy" - How different styles clash and complement
