 I've opened my pocket multiple times ðŸ§ ðŸ’¡  
(each with the conviction that I needed what was inside right now)  
  
But I didn't feel trapped; I felt convinced.  
  
Joining [Tiago Forte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiagoforte/)'s Building a Second Brain cohort #18 changed my life.  
Similarly, [Billy Broas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billybroas/)' Five Lightbulbs Marketing course.  
This course transformed my view of marketing.  
  
And both courses hooked me with their powerful,  
argumentation-based marketing that spoke directly to me.  
  
Now, I'm diving into the first cohort of the Five Lightbulbs with AI workshop series.Â It's mind-blowing how it supercharges marketing â€”  
it is Simple Marketing for Smart People, amplified by AI.  
  
And I'm only halfway through! Here are some insights I've gained so far:  
ðŸ’¡Smart Argumentation:  
Using AI to challenge arguments and anticipate customer objections.  
ðŸ’¡Customer Journey Mapping:  
Leveraging AI to think through the customer journey and create claims with proofs at each step.  
ðŸ’¡AI Coaching: Integrating the Five Lightbulbs framework into ChatGPT to develop marketing assets with AI as a coach.  
  
AI's extension of the Five Lightbulbs Argumentation approach is remarkable.  
It's hard to explain; you need to experience it and level up your marketing game.  
  
With Billy starting the next cohort soon, I didn't want to miss the chance to highly recommend it.

Feel free to reach out for further insights from someone in the trenches. ðŸš€

## Content preparation

I opened my pocket now several times
(all with the conviction - I need that NOW)

And I did not feel trapped, but convinced. 

I joined Tiago Fortes Building a Second Brain cohort #18 and it changed my life. 
I joined Billy Broas' Five Lightbulbs Marketing course 
and it changed my image of marketing. 
For both courses I got hooked through the awesome argumentation based marketing. The reasoning talked straight to me. 

What should I say - I'm currently running through the first cohort of the Five Lightbulbs With AI workshop series. I did it again!
And It's mind blowing as it is supercharging marketing. It is Simple Marketing for Smart People, amplified with AI. I'm just halfway through and already got so many insights like:
+ Deep dive on smart argumentation. And leveraging AI for challenging the argumentation and providing customer objections to work with
+ Using AI for thinking through the customer journey and deriving claims combined with proofs for each step in the journey
+ Loading the whole Five Lightbulbs to ChatGPT and using AI as your coach to derive marketing assets

It is just crazy how well AI extends the Five Lightbulbs Argumentation approach. Tough to explain, I guess you need to experience that too if you want to level up your marketing game.

As I know that Billy starts the next cohort soon, I wanted to not miss the opportunity to highly recommend it here too - here you can join the waiting list:

Let me know if you might need further insights from someone just being in the trenches.
