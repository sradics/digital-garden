Just back from The DOCK AI forum by [Langdock](https://www.linkedin.com/company/langdock/)!  
  
What a great experience  
The insights on AI adoption were mind-blowing.  
This wasn't your typical tech conference.  
  
Here's what hit me hard:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ AI is becoming a commodity. The real competitive advantage?  
â†’ How fast you integrate it into your company's DNA.  
  
The winning formula isn't top-down OR bottom-upIt's BOTH:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ C-level vision + grassroots champions  
â†’ "Gentle onboarding" moving people from hesitant to confident  
â†’ Internal AI communities with hackathons and 30-day challenges  
  
My biggest takeaway?  
â€”â€”â€”  
It's all about human-centered change management.  
Not replacing humans. Freeing us to be MORE human.  
  
And I'mÂ looking forward to the upcoming features presented.  
These will be super helpful in managing the day-to-day messy work.  
(not exposing any details here)  
  
Massive thanks to the Langdock team:  
â€”â€”â€”  
âœ“ Incredible welcome culture  
âœ“ Awesome venue+ organization  
âœ“ Delicious food keeping energy high  
âœ“ So many moments for genuine conversations  
  
This was a special day! Lot's to reflect and implement.  
  
My concrete next step: Explore the new W......w feature.
