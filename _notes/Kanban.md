## Highlights
A process needed to be adapted for each specific situation. To do this would require active leadership on each team. This was often lacking. — location: [371](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=371) ^ref-42525

---
It’s an iterative approach to improving performance systematically by identifying and removing bottlenecks. — location: [392](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=392) ^ref-45315

---
Manufacturing has low variability, while much of software development is highly variable and seeks to exploit variability through novelty in design in order to drive profit. Software is by nature “soft” and often can be changed easily and cheaply, while manufacturing tends to center on “hard” things that are difficult to change. It’s natural to be skeptical about the value of kanban systems in software development and other IT work. Much of what we, as a community, have learned — location: [457](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=457) ^ref-46210

---
By doing this we can achieve a sustainable pace of development so that all individuals can achieve a work versus personal life balance. — location: [548](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=548) ^ref-63160

---
Kanban systems can be used in any situation in which there is a desire to limit a quantity of things inside a system. — location: [616](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=616) ^ref-36293

---
Asking people to change their behavior creates fear and lowers self-esteem, as it communicates that existing skills are clearly no longer valued. — location: [650](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=650) ^ref-24581

---
This implies that it is common for teams to spend more than 90 percent of their effort fixing defects. — location: [690](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=690) ^ref-31009

---
Encouraging high initial quality will have a big impact on the productivity and throughput of teams with high defect rates. — location: [693](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=693) ^ref-14596

---
Professional testers should do testing. — location: [697](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=697) ^ref-43324

I encourage teams to inspect code every day for at least 30 minutes. — location: [704](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=704) ^ref-23164

---
I encourage teams to hold collaborative team analysis and design modeling sessions. — location: [706](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=706) ^ref-39512

There is causation between quantity of work-in-progress and average lead time, and the relationship is linear. — location: [759](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=759) ^ref-42740

---
Longer lead times seem to be associated with significantly poorer quality. In fact, an approximately six-and-a-half times increase in average lead time resulted in a greater than 30-fold increase in initial defects. — location: [761](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=761) ^ref-4812

---
Since uncovering this evidence I have managed work-in-progress as a means to control quality and have become convinced of the relationship between the quantity of WIP and initial quality. — location: [763](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=763) ^ref-44241

iterations are better than four-week iterations and that one-week iterations are better still. Shorter iterations will drive higher quality. — location: [768](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=768) ^ref-59925

that all you need for success in agile development is a small team of really good people. — location: [793](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=793) ^ref-42614

---
Sociologists call it social capital. What they’ve learned is that trust is event driven and that small, frequent gestures or events enhance trust more than larger gestures made only occasionally. — location: [797](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=797) ^ref-10724

---
Small gestures often cost nothing but build more trust than large, expensive (or expansive) gestures bestowed occasionally. And so it is with software development. — location: [803](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=803) ^ref-59206

---
So much of knowledge transfer and information discovery in software development is tacit in nature and is created during collaborative working sessions, face-to-face. — location: [810](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=810) ^ref-44664

---
Our minds have a limited capacity to store all this tacit knowledge and it degrades while we store it. — location: [812](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=812) ^ref-49251

---
If a team is co-located and always available to each other, this memory loss can be corrected through repeated discussion or tapping the shared memory of a group of people. — location: [813](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=813) ^ref-28408

---
Regardless of this, tacit knowledge depreciates with time, so shorter lead times are essential for tacit knowledge processes. — location: [815](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=815) ^ref-12266

---
we will set the rate at which we accept new requirements into our software development pipe to correspond with the rate at which we can deliver working code. — location: [820](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=820) ^ref-37963

---
The throughput of your process will be constrained by a bottleneck. — location: [824](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=824) ^ref-16965

---
Only the bottleneck resources will remain fully loaded. — location: [827](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=827) ^ref-57332

---
You need slack to enable continuous improvement. You need to balance demand against throughput and limit the quantity of work-in-progress to enable slack. — location: [836](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=836) ^ref-30887

---
Although this may look efficient and satisfy typical twentieth-century management accounting practices, it will impede the creation of an improvement culture. — location: [839](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=839) ^ref-60181

---
You need slack to enable continuous improvement. In order to have slack, you must have an unbalanced value stream with a bottleneck resource. Optimizing for utilization is not desirable. — location: [840](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=840) ^ref-60805

---
Most organizations are incapable of measuring and reporting business value delivered. They must first build capability in basic skills before they try greater challenges. — location: [858](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=858) ^ref-14172

---
First, learn to build high-quality code. Then reduce the work-in-progress, shorten lead times, and release often. — location: [861](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=861) ^ref-15683

---
Next, balance demand against throughput, limit work-in-progress, and create slack to free up bandwidth, which will enable improvements. Then, with a smoothly functioning and optimizing software development capability, improve prioritization to optimize value delivery. — location: [862](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=862) ^ref-22089

variability in the size of requirements, and in the amount of effort expended on analysis, design, coding, testing, build integration, and delivery adversely affect the throughput of a process and the costs of running a software development value stream. — location: [873](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=873) ^ref-21333

---
Poor quality can represent the largest waste in software development. — location: [886](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=886) ^ref-53111

---
Improved quality improves trust with downstream partners such as operations. Releasing frequently improves trust with upstream partners such as marketing. — location: [888](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=888) ^ref-16892

---
Prioritization is of little value without good initial quality and predictability of delivery. — location: [895](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=895) ^ref-4138

---
This meant that 70 or more requests were being reprioritized and rescheduled each month, and that requests were taking more than four months, on average, to process. This was the root cause of the dissatisfaction. — location: [946](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=946) ^ref-17006

---
These requests were small, and the constant reprioritization meant that requestors were being continually disappointed. — location: [948](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=948) ^ref-13301

---
Dragos began to mine the data and discovered that an average request took 11 days of engineering. However, lead times of 125 to 155 days were typical. — location: [951](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=951) ^ref-26828

---
90 percent of the lead time was queuing, or other forms of waste. — location: [952](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=952) ^ref-13586

---
We quickly calculated that the estimation effort alone was consuming around 33 percent of capacity, and on a bad month it could be as much as 40 percent. — location: [956](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=956) ^ref-29672

“kaizen culture.” — location: [1097](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1097) ^ref-59098

---
The underlying norm is for management to be tolerant of failure if the experimentation and innovation was in the name of process- and performance improvement. In a kaizen culture, individuals are free (within some limits) to self-organize around the work they do and how they do — location: [1108](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1108) ^ref-65457

---
Adopting Kanban is an investment in the long term capability, maturity, and culture of your organization. It is not intended as a quick fix. — location: [1138](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1138) ^ref-10879

---
A kaizen culture is one in which individuals feel empowered, act without fear, affiliate spontaneously, collaborate, and innovate. — location: [1326](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1326) ^ref-58735

Kanban provides transparency on both the work and the process through which the work flows. — location: [1329](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1329) ^ref-3141

Everything from which the team members and other partners, participants, and stakeholders derive their self-esteem, professional pride, and ego should be left unchanged. — location: [1351](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1351) ^ref-62984

It is necessary to decide where to start and end process visualization, and in doing so, define the interface points with upstream and downstream partners. — location: [1359](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1359) ^ref-55479

---
Successful teams have tended to stick to adopting workflow visualization with cards and limiting WIP within their own political sphere of control, and negotiating a new way of interacting with immediate upstream and downstream partners. — location: [1361](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1361) ^ref-4973

Typical work item types seen on teams adopting Kanban have included, but are not limited to, the following. — location: [1374](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1374) ^ref-8298

---
It is easy enough to visualize the types by using different colors of ticket or different rows (swim lanes) on a card wall. — location: [1385](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1385) ^ref-34546

---
Each order of magnitude should have its own type. — location: [1386](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1386) ^ref-54809

---
Note that for activity steps it is necessary to model both the in-progress and the completed work; by convention this is done by splitting the column. — location: [1404](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1404) ^ref-38335

---
A well-designed work item card is a key enabler of a high-trust culture and a Lean organization. — location: [1484](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1484) ^ref-55762

---
Some teams have adapted this model by using different colors or shapes of ticket to show the different activities. — location: [1515](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1515) ^ref-9087

---
The focus is on flow of work. — location: [1605](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1605) ^ref-40802

---
Ideally, a prioritization meeting will involve several product owners or business people from potentially competing groups within the company. The tension created by this actually becomes a positive influence on good decision making and stimulates a healthy, collaborative environment with the software development team. If only one product owner attends, there is the potential for the interaction to be adversarial. — location: [1636](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1636) ^ref-41900

weekly is a commonly recommended interval. — location: [1646](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1646) ^ref-57858

Release Planning Meetings Release planning meetings happen specifically to plan downstream delivery. — location: [1653](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1653) ^ref-16518

---
The purpose of triaging the backlog is to reduce its size. The benefit of a smaller backlog is that it facilitates easier prioritization discussions. — location: [1691](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1691) ^ref-51331

---
Issue management and escalation is typically done very badly, even in Agile development organizations. — location: [1713](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1713) ^ref-2717

Best practice is to use both a physical card wall and an electronic tracking system. — location: [1744](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1744) ^ref-10728

---
Grooming the backlog with regular triage to reduce its size improves the effectiveness and efficiency of prioritization meetings. — location: [1757](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1757) ^ref-48421

---
Escalation paths and policies should be clearly defined. — location: [1760](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1760) ^ref-20738

---
For example, every second Wednesday, as was the case for maintenance releases of IT applications at Corbis. — location: [1769](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1769) ^ref-41845

---
However, Kanban avoids any dysfunction introduced by artificially forcing things into time-boxes. — location: [1780](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1780) ^ref-771

---
The marketplace responded to this by developing more sophisticated ways for analyzing and writing user stories. — location: [1785](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1785) ^ref-54631

---
This has led to several dysfunctions. The first is to reverse the trend to smaller iterations and go back to larger ones. — location: [1790](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1790) ^ref-13973

---
The latter two make a mockery of the notion of time-boxed iterations and disguise the fact that work is actually still in progress when it is being reported as completed. — location: [1795](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1795) ^ref-49622

So it is important to understand the coordination costs associated with making a delivery. — location: [1817](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1817) ^ref-41746

Do things in larger batches in order to amortize the costs over longer periods of time. — location: [1873](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1873) ^ref-13607

---
Choice (b) focuses on reducing of waste by reducing coordination and transaction costs in order to make the batch size efficient—in this case, to make the time between releases efficient. — location: [1875](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1875) ^ref-47955

---
What is most important is that you, the team, and the organization are aware of the costs of making a delivery—in both time and money—and are capable of making some form of rational assessment about the acceptable frequency of delivery. — location: [1891](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1891) ^ref-2856

---
Reducing coordination and transaction costs is at the heart of Lean. — location: [1909](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1909) ^ref-34657

---
Regular delivery also helps to build trust. Lack of predictability destroys trust. — location: [1916](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1916) ^ref-4665

---
When coordination costs are low, there is no benefit from scheduling coordination activities regularly. — location: [1920](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1920) ^ref-47919

---
Kanban decouples delivery cadence from both development lead time and prioritization cadence. — location: [1950](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1950) ^ref-63565

---
Delivery cadence can be established by comparing the cost of producing a release against the value received from that release. — location: [1959](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=1959) ^ref-56493

---
These requests would have to be rerouted to a major project and so would likely take months or years before being implemented. The system was neither rapid nor responsive prior to the introduction of a kanban system. So the RR in RRT was also meaningless. — location: [2007](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=2007) ^ref-15512

Weekly is a good schedule for prioritization cadence. It provides frequent interaction with business — location: [2025](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=2025) ^ref-40516

---
By avoiding detailed estimates as much as possible, the transaction costs are minimized, which facilitates more frequent prioritization meetings. — location: [2059](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=2059) ^ref-38935

---
In general, because of this coordination-cost effect, these Agile planning methods are efficient only for small teams focused on single systems and product lines. — location: [2078](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=2078) ^ref-19534

By choosing to eliminate estimation for most classes of service, both the transaction costs and the coordination costs of prioritization are reduced. — location: [2080](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=2080) ^ref-34134

---
Kanban removes potential dysfunction around the coordination of iteration planning in Agile methods by decoupling the prioritization cadence from the development lead time and delivery. — location: [2118](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=2118) ^ref-9605

A typical standard class service-level agreement might offer a 30-day lead time with 80 percent due-date performance. In other words, four out of five requests should be delivered within 30 days. — location: [2447](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=2447) ^ref-61553

The service-level agreement allows us to avoid costly activities, such as estimation; low-trust activities, such as making commitments; and to spread risk by aggregating a large collection of requests — location: [2464](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=2464) ^ref-42501

If the user-experience designer reports that she is blocked for some external reason, the project manager and, if necessary, the whole team should swarm on the issue to get it resolved. — location: [3615](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=3615) ^ref-46350

A strong organizational capability at issue identification, escalation, and resolution is essential for effective exploitation of capacity-constrained bottlenecks. — location: [3616](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=3616) ^ref-53404

The most common way to avoid such idle time is to protect the bottleneck resource with a buffer of work. — location: [3634](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=3634) ^ref-29003

---
From a Lean perspective, adding a buffer of work adds waste, and it increases lead times. However, the throughput advantage provided by ensuring a steady flow of work through our capacity-constrained resource is usually a better trade. — location: [3636](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=3636) ^ref-30735

This is the essence of a subordination action. Something else will need to change in order to improve the exploitation of the bottleneck. — location: [3657](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=3657) ^ref-53452

---
For those knowledgeable about the Theory of Constraints it is often counter-intuitive to realize that the changes required to improve performance in a bottleneck are usually not made at the bottleneck. — location: [3658](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=3658) ^ref-49571

---
As a general rule, expect to maximize exploitation of bottleneck capacity, and hence maximize throughput, and as a result, minimize the delivery time on your project by taking actions all over the value stream, and most likely not at the bottleneck itself. — location: [3664](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=3664) ^ref-19111

Despite the tactical nature of exploitation of a bottleneck, the gains can often be dramatic. Two-and-one-half- to five-times improvements in throughput, with consequent drops in lead time, can often be achieved at little to no cost over a short period of months. — location: [3806](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=3806) ^ref-15463

So the project has some setup activities that are essential before the value-added work can start. — location: [3837](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=3837) ^ref-50278

In summary, both projects and iterations have setup activities. — location: [3846](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=3846) ^ref-23020

In economic terms, these setup and cleanup activities are referred to as transaction costs. — location: [3853](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=3853) ^ref-12821

Most projects also have cleanup costs and other related back-end transaction costs, such as delivery to the customer, tear down of environments, retrospectives, reviews, audits, user training, and so on. — location: [3862](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=3862) ^ref-12638

Each email read and answered is a coordination activity. When they complain that they can’t do value-added work—such as analysis, programming, or testing—because they are always in meetings, these meetings are also coordination activities. — location: [3872](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=3872) ^ref-38383

---
In general, any form of meeting is a coordination activity, including favorites of the Agile community, such as daily standup meetings, unless the meeting is designed to produce a customer-valued deliverable. — location: [3874](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=3874) ^ref-6727

---
If we view software and systems development as an information-arrival process, in which our starting point is no information, and complete information represents working functionality that meets the customer’s needs and intent, then any information that arrives between the starting point and end point—that moves us forward toward working functionality that meets the customer’s needs—is value-adding information. — location: [3878](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=3878) ^ref-3851

---
As such, you should seek to reduce or eliminate coordination meetings. — location: [3884](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=3884) ^ref-47912

---
One way is to empower team members to self-organize. Command-and-control type management, in which people meet in order to assign tasks to individuals in advance, is wasteful. — location: [3888](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=3888) ^ref-15494

It is better to let team members self-assign tasks. Self-organization generally reduces the coordination costs on a project. — location: [3890](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=3890) ^ref-4714

---
In general, the more information that can be made transparent to the knowledge workers on the team, the more self-organization will be possible and the fewer coordination activities will be required. — location: [3895](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=3895) ^ref-32754

Expediting is known in industrial engineering to be bad. It affects predictability of other requests. It increases mean lead time and the spread of variability and it reduces throughput. — location: [4118](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0057H2M70&location=4118) ^ref-55613

The biggest drawback to using greater WIP limits is that there is less (or no) tension to provoke discussion and implementation of improvements.

By taking the time to define escalation paths and write policy around it, the team knows where to send issues for resolution.
