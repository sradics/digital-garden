# Key elements for writing simply

[Source](http://www.paulgraham.com/simply.html)

+ **Using ordinary words** and **simple sentences** to make writing easier to read and understand.
+ Ensuring that writing is accessible, allowing ideas to leap into the reader's head without them noticing the words used.
+ **Being considerate of the reader** by not using fancy writing to impress, which can burden the reader with extra work.
+ **Writing simply to be clear**, especially for non-native English speakers, as it ensures that the ideas are conveyed without relying on difficult words.
+ **Avoiding fancy writing that can conceal the lack of ideas**, as simple writing reveals the true content and keeps the writer honest.
+ Creating work that lasts, as simple writing is more likely to be understood in the future when culture and language may have changed.
+ **Editing rigorously**, which often involves **cutting out unnecessary parts**, leading to even simpler writing.
+ Choosing to use complicated sentences or fancy words intentionally for effect, not by accident.
