The Great KINGDOMINO Downfall:  
â†’ A Father's Tale of Defeat ðŸ˜…  
  
Five losses in a row. FIVE!  
  
Am I getting old, or are these kids secretly turning into strategic masterminds?  
  
Let's be real - I'm the board game guy. Usually, I win!  
(Yeah, right... I can hear you snickering)  
  
Back in my glory days, KINGDOMINO was my kingdom.  
They practically called me the king.*  
(*at least that's how I remember it... selective memory is a gift)  
  
Reality check:  
A brutal 6:1 defeat by our first arriver over Christmas.  
With three more kids arriving soon, ready to complete my dethronement.  
  
My "totally-not-serious" survival strategies:  
â†’ Operation Food Coma: Heavy lunch = sluggish opponent  
â†’ The Christmas Present Leverageâ„¢ (What extensions? They might mysteriously vanish...)  
â†’ Strategic Board "Modifications" (Just kidding... mostly ðŸ˜…)  
  
But since I'm trying to be a role model here (sigh), my actual plan:  
â†’ Back to probability basics (math never betrays you)  
â†’ Testing new tactics (there must be a winning combo somewhere)  
â†’ Actually using my 5x5 field properly (revolutionary, I know)  
  
The real lessons here:  
â†’ Sometimes you need a good beating to learn  
â†’ Experiment, fail, adjust, repeat  
â†’ Cherish these moments - even when they crush your gaming ego  
  
Age might have taken my quick reflexes, but it gave me wisdom...  
(At least that's what I tell myself while losing)  
  
Your turn: What's your favorite board game? Are you still the champion, or have the kids dethroned you too?  
  
P.S. Steve - That table tennis challenge still haunts me. Rematch?  

â€”â€”â€”  
P.S.  
I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease  
(but I exclude Kingdomino for now)
