I built a thing to assess my own learning.  
  
â†’ Ended up surprising myself.  
  
So I created this self-assessment for the 16 different aspects we cover in Learning Ecosystem Mastery.  
  
Figured I should probably test it on myself first, right?  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
How it works:  
  
You ask it to start the assessment, and it walks through each topic.  
  
â†’ Gives you a little quote  
â†’ Asks a reflection question  
â†’ Explains why that point matters  
â†’ You rate yourself 0-5  
  
Pretty straightforward.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
The interesting part?  
  
After going through all 16 areas, it shows you:  
  
â†’ Your total score out of 80  
â†’ Where your strengths are  
â†’ Development zones (fancy way of saying "stuff to work on")  
â†’ Next steps that actually make sense for you  
  
You can even pick one improvement suggestion and ask it to explain more.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
What I learned about myself:  
  
My capture system isn't as solid as I thought.  
  
And some areas I was worried about? Turned out fine.  
  
It's funny how self-reflection works when you have a framework for it.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
Anyway, thought you might find it useful.  
  
If you want to try it out, just let me know.  
  
It's a nice way to see what this whole "learning ecosystem" thing is actually about.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
P.S. I externalized it as a GPT because... well, that's what I do with most things these days. Makes it easier to share and iterate on.
