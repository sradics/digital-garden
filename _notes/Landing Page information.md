Reference points
- my externalized insights from 3 years of working with a Second Brain

3 years ago marked a pivotal point in my way of working with information. 

Until then I faced a massive overload. Too much, no structure. 
I read a lot, retained little. Many of the outcomes I created where one-time results, barely reusable in other contexts. I did not like the situations when I had to redo work, just because I did not find my previous version. When I had to re-read, because I did not take care to extract my main insights in the first place. 

Then I discovered the Second Brain approach. And this changed everything. I found my way to work with all kinds of information. And I grew my personalized, huge stack of course insights, project outcomes, book notes ... basically everything where I did invest time in ... 

Now I can build with this information. When I have to give a presentation, when I need to design an workshop, when I support others ... I can rely on my own externalized experience. It makes me fast, it enables new options, it makes me flexible. 

And you can get there too. I remember when I started. It felt a little overwhelming. Back then, I wished to get a quick start. To understand the main aspects and to get it started easily. 

In this workshop, I provide you such an entry point.
