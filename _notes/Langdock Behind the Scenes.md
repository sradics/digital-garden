My AI Command Center: 3 Ways I use [Langdock](https://www.linkedin.com/company/langdock/)  
  
(Join my free demonstration to see it in action)  
  
âž  Multi-LLM Access  
â€”â€”â€”  
I seamlessly switch between Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini through a single platformâ€”saving both time and subscription costs while using the right tool for each job.  
  
âž  AI Assistant Creation  
â€”â€”â€”  
I've built 32 specialized assistants that transform my workflow, including:  
  
â†’ A LinkedIn post drafter with a Hookline Expert and a Platitude nerd  
â†’ A Five Lightbulbs Marketing Assistant for targeted campaign support  
â†’ A 4MAT expert for workshop design optimization  

âž  Second Brain Integration  
â€”â€”â€”  
Direct access to my knowledge base eliminates copy-paste inefficiencies. I can now augment AI with my personal context, supercharging my knowledge-building process.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
Curious how this works?
