5,500 messages in 12 months. All on Langdock. 

â†’ Here's why this AI platform is my choice

I found my home with Langdock 2 years ago.
Now I work with 72 AI assistants. 

Think of it like a team of highly specialized co-workers.
Just recently I added 6 avatars, implementing personas.

The Langdock team is regularly adding new capabilities. 
One recently added feature: I can call my assistants into active conversations. 

Picture this scenario:
â€”â€”â€”
I'm drafting a post with Lexicon 
(my writing assistant, trained on my voice and a writing expert)

While writing, I often need further special expertise. 

When I need my  business context, I type @Data and he joins the conversation
(Data is my business expert, he knows my programs, my approach, and my business)

I can ask @Julia: "What is your take on my post? " and she adds her challenging perspective.
(Julia is one of my 6 personas, and I love to get her perspective)

Three specialists. One seamless conversation.

And this is just one among many more super useful features of Langdock. 

Want to get more insights from someone with 2 years of Langdock experience? 

Happy to jump on a call and assist.

DM me "LANGDOCK"

P.S.
Langdock-Team - you're building something extraordinary, keep it up!
