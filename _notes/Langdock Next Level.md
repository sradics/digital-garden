THIS JUST IN: Langdock's update lets you build 5X more powerful AI assistants  
  
â†’ 32 AI assistants built, 3 LLMs integrated  
  
[Langdock](https://www.linkedin.com/company/langdock/) just dropped a game-changing update,  
and I'm excited about the new possibilities  
  
This powerful AI platform now offers:  
  
â†’ Seamless integration with Google ecosystem (Mail, Calendar, Drive)  
â†’ easier Vector-Database connectivity for handling large datasets  
â†’ Custom integration capabilities with additional services  
  
Building AI assistants has become both  
more powerful and more accessible.  
  
My go-to use cases for Langdock:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Multi-LLM Access  
  
I primarily use Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini. Having them all at my fingertips through a single platform saves me both time and money.  

â†’ AI Assistant Creation  
  
I've already crafted 32 specialized assistants, including:  
  
â†³ A LinkedIn post drafter with a Hookline Expert and a Platitude nerd  
â†³ A Five Lightbulbs Marketing Assistant for targeted campaign support  
â†³ A 4MAT expert for workshop design optimization  

â†’ Second Brain Integration  
  
Direct access to my knowledge base eliminates copy-paste inefficiencies. I can now augment AI with my personal context, supercharging my knowledge-building process.  

Langdock will be a cornerstone in my upcoming Learning Superpower program. This integration allows me to:  
â†’ Collaborate with participants using shared Prompts and Assistants  
â†’ Conduct comparative experiments across different LLMs  

Kudos to the Langdock team for consistently delivering impressive updates. Your commitment to innovation has earned you a dedicated fan.  
  
Intrigued by Langdock's potential?  
I'm considering a live demo of my setup.  
  
Comment "LIVE" if you'd join a session on  
AI assistants, workflow integration, and productivity hacks.
