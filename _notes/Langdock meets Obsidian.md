I connected my 2nd brain to AI â€“ here's what happened  
  
â†’ Obsidian meets [Langdock](https://www.linkedin.com/company/langdock/) meets Five Lightbulbs  
  
I just created a quick demo showing how I work with my Obsidian knowledge base connected with Langdock AI  
  
In the video, I demonstrate how I queried my AI to analyze my recent LinkedIn posts and identify my strongest Lightbulb 3 examples (from Billy's Five Lightbulbs framework).  
  
The magic happens when my AI assistant fetches content directly from my Obsidian vault using the getFile command.  
  
This creates a seamless bridge between:  
â†’ My structured knowledge in Obsidian  
â†’ The analytical power of AI in Langdock  
â†’ The marketing framework I've learned from [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAADIwlUBRzxXl9jQaCOCKhUAm_B_BF8XDYg)[Billy Broas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billybroas/)'s courses  
  
What excites me most is how this integration lets me leverage years of accumulated knowledge with AI's analytical capabilities.  
  
Instead of just generic AI responses, I get insights based on MY content and MY learning journey.  
  
Have you connected your knowledge systems with AI yet?  
What integrations are you most excited about?
