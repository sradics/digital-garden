## Highlights
A less defined process leads to more learning. More with less. — location: [200](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=200) ^ref-11181

---
Scrum is an empirical-process-control development framework in which a cross-functional self-managing Team develops a product in an iterative incremental manner. — location: [225](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=225) ^ref-39423

---
It’s based on understanding that in development things are too complex and dynamic for detailed and formulaic process recipes, which inhibit questioning, engagement, improvement. — location: [235](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=235) ^ref-23976

---
LeSS is Scrum applied to many teams working together on one product. — location: [240](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=240) ^ref-65144

---
product—What product? A broad complete end-to-end customer-centric solution that real customers use. It’s not a component, platform, layer, or library. — location: [259](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=259) ^ref-33414

---
There are no such things as best practices in product development. There are only practices that are adequate within a certain context. — location: [293](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=293) ^ref-34872

---
And pushing so-called best practices kills a culture of learning, questioning, engagement, and continuous improvement. — location: [296](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=296) ^ref-21609

---
Shu—follow rules to learn basics. Ha—break rules and discover context. Ri—mastery and find your own way. — location: [304](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=304) ^ref-45479

---
less—We don’t want more roles because more roles leads to less responsibility to Teams. — location: [337](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=337) ^ref-60685

---
Instead we want more responsible Teams by having less (fewer) roles, we want more customer-focused Teams building useful products by having less artifacts, we want more Team ownership of process and more meaningful work by having less defined processes. — location: [340](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=340) ^ref-20331

---
Increase and strengthen feedback loops with real customers. Everyone understands how their work today directly relates to and benefits paying customers. — location: [346](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=346) ^ref-14324

---
thinking—See, understand, and optimize the whole system1 (not parts), and use systems modeling to explore system dynamics. — location: [352](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=352) ^ref-36372

---
Customers care about the overall concept-to-cash cycle time and flow, not individual steps, and locally optimizing a part almost always sub-optimizes the whole. — location: [355](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=355) ^ref-64974

---
The system is everyone and everything from concept to cash, and all its dynamics in time and space, primarily from the customer and user perspective. — location: [357](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=357) ^ref-51259

---
On the other hand, we suggest first trying to get better, smaller, and simpler, before getting huger. — location: [375](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=375) ^ref-45000

a Scrum Master for one to three Teams. — location: [388](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=388) ^ref-46288

---
Over the last two Sprints their team clarified these items in detail, in single-team Product Backlog refinement (PBR) workshops. — location: [443](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=443) ^ref-49029

---
Tip: Teams choose their items — location: [445](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=445) ^ref-64746

---
Tip: Don’t pre-decide division of items to teams — location: [454](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=454) ^ref-12373

---
Tip: Spread high-order items — location: [463](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=463) ^ref-47483

---
Tip: Diverge to clarify In parallel, Mira, Mark, and the others think hard about final minor points to clear up for their items, and write some questions on flip-chart papers on the walls around the room. Paolo roams around to different areas, discussing. Everyone mingles and contributes. — location: [472](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=472) ^ref-49987

---
RULE: Each Team has its own Sprint Backlog — location: [482](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=482) ^ref-48492

---
RULE: Do multi-team SP2 in a shared space for closely related items. — location: [486](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=486) ^ref-10367

---
That’s useful, because the group uses integration as a way to inform and support their coordination. — location: [509](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=509) ^ref-17191

---
On the second day of the Sprint, — location: [532](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=532) ^ref-46469

---
RULE: An Overall Retrospective is held after the Team Retrospectives to discuss cross-team and system-wide issues, and to create improvement experiments. This is attended by Product Owner, Scrum Masters, Team Representatives, and managers (if any). — location: [535](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=535) ^ref-36736

---
Time to stop and fix! This Sprint, Team Trade is responsible for it, and it’s one of Mark’s secondary specialties, so he volunteers to fix it and asks another team member to pair up with him to help his colleague learn more about it. — location: [569](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=569) ^ref-36555

---
Once again—about every 10 minutes—he pushes the tiny change to the central shared repository (to “head of trunk”), to integrate continuously with his team and all others. — location: [579](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=579) ^ref-36646

---
Paolo starts by sharing his current thinking on product direction and where to go next in the short term and, most importantly, why. — location: [590](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=590) ^ref-13843

---
The representatives from three teams (including Trade and Margin) decide to later do multi-team PBR together for some items to increase their shared understanding and because they are strongly related. And representatives from two other teams choose items to focus on separately in team PBR sessions. — location: [608](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=608) ^ref-2337

---
RULE: All prioritization goes through the Product Owner, but clarification is as much as possible directly between the Teams and customer/users and other stakeholders. — location: [618](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=618) ^ref-51973

---
Also, one of the company’s three lawyers specializing in financial regulations and compliance joins one of these teams to help them in clarification. — location: [621](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=621) ^ref-34605

---
Tip: Use a wiki for item details — location: [627](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=627) ^ref-47504

---
“Now suppose there are eight teams and eight team backlogs. What if, from the higher company or product perspective, for some reason, the items in two of the eight team backlogs are actually by far the most important or highest priority. — location: [639](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=639) ^ref-37310

---
Does that seem inflexible or flexible—agile? And does that optimize people working on the highest-impact stuff from the company perspective?” — location: [648](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=648) ^ref-24154

---
RULE: There is one Product Owner and one Product Backlog for the complete shippable product. — location: [653](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=653) ^ref-42055

---
RULE: The Product Owner shouldn’t work alone on Product Backlog refinement; she is supported by the multiple Teams working directly with customers/users and other stakeholders. — location: [665](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=665) ^ref-65421

---
Tip: Discuss direction for upcoming Sprints — location: [699](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=699) ^ref-28850

---
In addition to a lead product manager—who often serves as Product Owner—many large groups have a few supporting product managers, each specializing in a major market segment or customer area. — location: [726](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=726) ^ref-52131

---
More splitting will happen later in a single-team or multi-team PBR session. — location: [749](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=749) ^ref-56893

---
they sketch a tree diagram with four arms representing a splitting into four major sub-items. But they don’t go any deeper—they’re avoiding over-analysis. — location: [750](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=750) ^ref-14476

---
He reviews with them the idea of Take a Bite: to just split off one tiny fragment, really understand that, and implement it quickly. Sam concludes, “You know, diagrams don’t crash and documents don’t run.” Guide: Take a Bite, p. 202 — location: [769](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=769) ^ref-56676

---
tiny bite of a thin customer-centric end-to-end item. — location: [773](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=773) ^ref-53843

---
Using specification by example Portia and Team Trade spend the rest of the day chewing on their bite. — location: [775](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=775) ^ref-44841

---
The mixed groups start clarifying different items in separate areas in the room, each with a whiteboard, big wall space, laptop, and projector. Tanya is with one group, Ted another, and Travis, the third. — location: [785](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=785) ^ref-62728

---
This organizational design yields slow inflexible development with (1) high levels of waste (inventory, work-in-progress, handoff, information scatter, ...), (2) long-delayed ROI, (3) complex planning and coordination, (4) more overhead management, — location: [823](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=823) ^ref-36570

---
division is around major areas of customer concerns called Requirement Areas. — location: [828](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=828) ^ref-15678

---
these could be some major areas of customer interest—Requirement Areas: — location: [834](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=834) ^ref-3246

---
Conceptually in the one Product Backlog, a Requirement Area attribute is added, and each item is classified into one and only one area: — location: [839](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=839) ^ref-34371

---
Area Product Owner who specializes in that area and focuses on its Area Product Backlog. — location: [850](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=850) ^ref-7843

---
Area feature teams — location: [855](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=855) ^ref-30949

---
they interact with their Area Product Owner as though she were the Product Owner, and so on. — location: [857](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=857) ^ref-55521

---
A Requirement Area normally has four to eight teams. An implication is that a Requirement Area is big. — location: [861](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=861) ^ref-48750

---
An early transitional situation when the group is incrementally growing a new area that is fully expected to ultimately have four or more teams. Then, start small — location: [872](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=872) ^ref-27306

We’re going to take the lead on early implementation, and getting the big picture of the item, and understanding the overall impact on our architecture.” — location: [996](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=996) ^ref-22701

In that setting, forcing LeSS into the organization encourages victimized behavior and further degrades relations. — location: [1206](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=1206) ^ref-50289

Prefer hands-on experience. Ensure that your trainer/coach has hands-on experience in LeSS from both inside (as a team member) and outside (as coach).

Automation—Much Undone Work was traditionally manual work and must be automated. Harmonization—Product groups have often solved the same problem many ways (e.g. four similar testing frameworks). Having all teams maintain tests in many similar but different technologies is rarely useful, and thus Teams need to agree on a standard. Environment—Some environments are hard to use or share (e.g. test equipment). Use might need to be improved and sharing must be agreed within the Teams. Alternatively, reduce dependency on environments by increasing virtualization. — location: [4308](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=4308) ^ref-4873

assumption is frequently incorrect and work can be parallelized by being done differently. Cross-functionality—Some Undone Work requires skills that aren’t yet in the Teams (e.g. technical writing).

Note! Thinking about interactions and causal relationships is the critical focus needed in systems thinking. And doubly so for large-scale systems, because the time and space are vast, and the interaction dynamics between the myriad parties are usually full of hidden but crucial facts and forces. — location: [5684](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=5684) ^ref-37136

For example, managers are pushed to increase velocity, and do the quick fix of hiring many lowcost (and it turns out in this case, weak) developers. In the short run this quick fix gives the appearance of increasing velocity. But there is a long-term delayed consequence of reduced code quality, leading to a slower velocity eleven months later. — location: [5697](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01JP91OR4&location=5697) ^ref-51285
