# Leadership roles in product development

## Product value leadership

==Leadership about product value‚Äîthe product vision and what the product does== ‚Äî location: [3375](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3375) ^ref-53340

then the vision can emerge through interactions, experiments, and analytical reflection. ‚Äî location: [3458](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3458) ^ref-19038

Aka product manager. 

Accountable for the business success of the product.

Needs to be in charge, so that others listen to them.

Needs a highly effective way of leveraging the minds of others.

==leverage experts, bring the right people together, stimulate thinking and discussions that led to novel approaches, and then initiated action that led eventually to breakthroughs==. ‚Äî location: [3431](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3431) ^ref-26825

The question of ==whether you need a vision reduces to how confident you are about the requirements==. ‚Äî location: [3440](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3440) ^ref-16820

If you are extremely confident, then a vision is superfluous; but if there is doubt, then ==a vision guides the process of discovering the best design, informed by talking to users and trying prototypes.== ‚Äî location: [3441](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3441) ^ref-31612

needs to be a vision, in other words, ==a concept for why the product is needed and what makes it special;== and there needs to be leadership driving that. ‚Äî location: [3442](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3442) ^ref-29503

==Know how to assess product success, in a business sense== Are‚Äîbecause of the previous items‚Äîin the best position (of all those besides users) to state what the product should do, in other words, provide product value leadership ‚Äî location: [3395](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3395) ^ref-21971

---

needs ==direct access to (even better, direct experience with) the user's ‚Äújobs to be done‚Äù== ‚Äî location: [3401](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3401) ^ref-47207

## Product implementation/development leadership

==Leadership about product development/implementation‚Äîthe product's creation and support== ‚Äî location: [3376](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3376) ^ref-60783

## Leadership about product development workflow

==Leadership about product development workflow‚Äîhow the teams work together, and with other stakeholders==, and the workflow and human dimensions Leadership about product technical practices‚Äîthe technical aspects of the workflow Individual leadership‚Äîhow individuals conduct themselves ‚Äî location: [3379](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3379) ^ref-22523

---

Operate the products' user-facing value stream(s) ‚Äî location: [3391](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3391) ^ref-21311

---

Via the previous point, oversee the delivery of value to users (and therefore the customer) ‚Äî location: [3392](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3392) ^ref-32213

---

Scrum aside, ==a team needs process leadership. That leadership can come from the team itself, or it can come from a designated team lead==. ‚Äî location: [3547](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3547) ^ref-45300

---

==Agile 2 Principle: Self-organization and autonomy are aspirations and should be given according to capability.== ‚Äî location: [3550](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3550) ^ref-25884

---

The team's ==process leadership should therefore be flexible, and the team should be empowered to largely define its own process==, ‚Äî location: [3552](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3552) ^ref-2056

---

==Keeping things organized is a full-time job and is a major distraction for a team, and if someone can be responsible for making sure that action items are tracked, issues are discussed== ‚Äî location: [3556](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3556) ^ref-55623

---

and resolved, ==decisions are published on the team's site or elsewhere, required external communications are published or sent, and so on, that relieves the team from having to think about those things==. ‚Äî location: [3558](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3558) ^ref-48440

---

The ==third dimension pertains to the technical tooling and automation of work steps==. ‚Äî location: [3571](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3571) ^ref-40283

---

==Creating the tooling and automation is a complex endeavor==; it is on par with the complexity and level of effort of the product itself. ‚Äî location: [3591](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3591) ^ref-4969

---

In effect, the ==tooling is the ‚Äúproduct that creates the product.‚Äù== ‚Äî location: [3592](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3592) ^ref-47403

---

It therefore ==requires technical leadership to make sure that it is designed, implemented, validated, and continuously improved==; ‚Äî location: [3593](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3593) ^ref-21711

---

Every team member should show leadership with regard to their participation on a team and in the organization. ‚Äî location: [3598](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3598) ^ref-43550

---

being ==proactive in learning what is needed to perform the tasks of the team; soliciting feedback on their performance; expressing ideas for improving the work and how the work is done==; ‚Äî location: [3599](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3599) ^ref-64261

## Component leadership

==Component‚Äîsomething that is used by products, services, or other components and that is versioned and maintained as a unit== ‚Äî location: [3338](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3338) ^ref-1129

---

out that each element needs leadership, and these elements do not form a hierarchy. ‚Äî location: [3344](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3344) ^ref-64877

---

requires leadership to maintain its cohesion and effectiveness over time and keep it pointed in the right direction, and some of these overlap. ‚Äî location: [3345](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3345) ^ref-49969

## Operational Leadership

---

==be interested in metrics such as cycle time and mean time to repair.== ‚Äî location: [3718](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3718) ^ref-9665

---

==An operational leader is overseeing a kind of assembly line. Lean principles strongly apply.== ‚Äî location: [3720](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3720) ^ref-52592

---

==One must ‚ÄúGemba walk‚Äù and stay aware of how the work is being done, rather than staying in one's office and looking only at metrics==. ‚Äî location: [3721](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3721) ^ref-62964

---

Teams that develop and support their own product still often need an operations group to help them, but such ==an operations group is focused on providing supporting services, such as the core technology platform, as well as defining standards. Each group needs leadership==. ‚Äî location: [3728](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3728) ^ref-35887

==development agility is contingent on a great deal of automation and the ability to create production-like test environments, as well as the availability of a high coverage regression test suite.== ‚Äî location: [3756](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3756) ^ref-61321

---

==Operational agility is measured by metrics such as the mean time to devise, validate, and deploy a fix.== ‚Äî location: [3758](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3758) ^ref-3213

---

This is often called ==mean time to repair==, or something similar. ‚Äî location: [3760](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3760) ^ref-46876

[[Gemba - Go where the work gets done]]

## Team Lead

Aka Engineering Manager

what they want to learn and then take steps to ==get them the opportunity to learn about that, they will be more committed.== ‚Äî location: [2825](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=2825) ^ref-16507

==Products are not hierarchical. A product can interact with many others, and some of those might even share components, such as core microservices==. ‚Äî location: [2703](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=2703) ^ref-12071

---

==There need to be people whose job it is to watch the entire product== ‚Äî location: [2717](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=2717) ^ref-12408

---

observe (or be told) when something is not right. Those people ==can in turn make judgments about who else might be affected‚Äîwhich other teams or products. They can then assemble the right people to work the problems.== ‚Äî location: [2717](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=2717) ^ref-43652

---

Drive a thoughtful and inclusive discussion. Push for an informed resolution. ==If there are competing theories and no timely consensus is possible, make an autocratic decision, but own it‚Äîtake responsibility for it, no matter the outcome==. But ‚Äî location: [2721](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=2721) ^ref-7318

---

==team lead== should always be ==looking ahead at the capabilities that might be needed== in the future ==and making sure that people are learning and will be ready==. ‚Äî location: [2819](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=2819) ^ref-46439

---

It also helps if there is ==someone who is able to inspire the team‚Äîto rally them and maintain morale==, or what some Agile coaches call team happiness. ‚Äî location: [3559](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3559) ^ref-17043

---

should t==ake an interest in the team's work and how the team members do their work‚Äîincluding the technical side==. ‚Äî location: [3562](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3562) ^ref-59247

---

==watching for potential process, behavioral, scheduling, or morale problems of any kind==. ‚Äî location: [3566](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3566) ^ref-15720

## Technical Architect

Leadership about product technical design - How the product works internally

---

The product's internal design. For a technology product, this is the product's architecture and technical design, which‚Äîfor an Agile approach‚Äîwill be created at a high level and then be refined over time. ‚Äî location: [3521](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3521) ^ref-25055

---

The human elements of the development and delivery process‚Äîwho does what, when they do it, etc. ‚Äî location: [3523](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3523) ^ref-48011

---

The technical elements of the development and delivery process ‚Äî location: [3524](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3524) ^ref-40623

---

who is designated as a ==technical architect for the product.== ‚Äî location: [3529](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3529) ^ref-24005

---

==role is a thought leadership role. Its purpose is to ensure cohesion and consistency within the product and spanning the product and other products within the organization's business platform==. ‚Äî location: [3530](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3530) ^ref-52122

---

inquisitive manner, soliciting ideas and sharing their own ideas. ‚Äî location: [3532](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3532) ^ref-5245

---

open Socratic discussions ‚Äî location: [3534](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3534) ^ref-52235

## Design Lead

---

Leading such a team is like leading a fast-paced research and development team‚Äînot of scientists, but of ‚Äúcreatives‚Äù‚Äîpeople who are typically artistic and intuitive by nature rather than highly analytical. ‚Äî location: [3485](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3485) ^ref-29201

---

The team ==needs some level or organization, and it needs to be results-oriented, but most of all it needs someone who is a ‚Äúpeople person,‚Äù because designers tend to work as a group, and group dynamics are in play most of the day.== ‚Äî location: [3489](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3489) ^ref-33812

---

The ==design lead== needs to ==make sure that product managers do not ‚Äúbeat up‚Äù the design team members if the design does not meet expectations.== ‚Äî location: [3495](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3495) ^ref-48955

---

has sufficient access to users, ‚Äî location: [3497](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3497) ^ref-2474

---

and has an ==effective and bidirectional flow of ideas between them and the marketing team==. ‚Äî location: [3498](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3498) ^ref-52625

## Research Lead

---

Research and development are often lumped together, but they are different activities. ‚Äî location: [3677](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3677) ^ref-13155

---

==The process of research needs to be much more loosely structured than the process of development==. When ‚Äî location: [3684](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3684) ^ref-49216

---

That makes development a little more like research. ==If you need to use something you have never used before, then you do not really know if you can do it==. There is uncertainty: ‚Äî location: [3688](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3688) ^ref-1590

---

but ==if too much research is involved, then it is not development anymore; it is prototyping==. ‚Äî location: [3694](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3694) ^ref-543

---

requires someone who is sensitive to the uncertainties of research. ‚Äî location: [3696](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3696) ^ref-49813

---

an ==effective research lead needs to be able to keep people focused on a goal==. ‚Äî location: [3698](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3698) ^ref-50064

---

An ==individual researcher tends to be either a theorist or an experimentalist,10 and it is important to understand the needs of each, because both are needed.== ‚Äî location: [3700](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3700) ^ref-32579

---

==Agility in research requires being ready to pivot==. ‚Äî location: [3703](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3703) ^ref-20438

---

==If an approach does not pan out, one must judge the eventual likelihood of success, because sometimes the most successful approaches are the ones that are difficult to achieve==; ‚Äî location: [3704](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3704) ^ref-37925

---

Thus, the process for evaluating a ‚Äústop‚Äù must be clear and not easily manipulated. ‚Äî location: [3669](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3669) ^ref-64496

---

==one must be an organizer and be someone who views everything as a system==. ‚Äî location: [3718](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3718) ^ref-49381

## Self leadership

---

==Agile 2 Principle: Professional development of individuals is essential.== ‚Äî location: [3606](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3606) ^ref-63562

---

voicing concerns when concerns become apparent; reaching out to other team members to help them when they need it; and being considerate of other team members by respecting their way of working, which might be different from one's own. ‚Äî location: [3600](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3600) ^ref-45700

---

==Self-leadership benefits from being able to organize, as well as being able to inspire oneself, to create the needed motivation.== ‚Äî location: [3615](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3615) ^ref-49648

## Any leader

They are able to ==align us and unite us==. By so doing, they bring us together for a ==common purpose to achieve a worthwhile goal.== ‚Äî location: [3827](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3827) ^ref-33661

---

They engender trust among their followers. So, their ==followers are willing to give their leaders power, authority, and resources to achieve the goal==. ‚Äî location: [3828](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3828) ^ref-38009

---

They are ==capable of negotiating with powerful groups on behalf of their followers==. Their followers trust the leader to represent the followers' interests and to make the right decisions for them. ‚Äî location: [3830](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3830) ^ref-13564

---

They ==know that they cannot do everything themselves. They ask others to help==. ‚Äî location: [3834](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3834) ^ref-51665

---

They ==inspire those who report to them to become leaders as well==. ‚Äî location: [3836](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3836) ^ref-63405

---

They ==give their people the authority and resources they need== ‚Äî location: [3837](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3837) ^ref-49866

---

They ==continuously assess people's abilities and give measured trust== in people ‚Äî location: [3839](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3839) ^ref-56716

---

They ==demonstrate the behavior they are asking for== from others. ‚Äî location: [3843](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3843) ^ref-42325

---

They are ==goal-oriented visionaries. They see far== with respect to the future of the group or organization. ‚Äî location: [3851](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=3851) ^ref-38949
