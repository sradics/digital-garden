## Highlights
requires integrating work across hundreds of developers and addressing all the inefficiencies of coordinating this work. These are issues that the individual teams can’t and won’t solve on their own. — location: [87](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=87) ^ref-17428

---
What we found in the end is that there were not dramatic differences in the teams’ productivity based on the methods they used. There were, though, dramatic improvements in the overall productivity of the entire organization. — location: [103](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=103) ^ref-61804

---
This lead to our conclusion that how teams come together to deliver value in large organizations is the first-order effect, while how individual teams work was a second-order effect. — location: [105](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=105) ^ref-57755

approach is that it is paramount to begin with business objectives. — location: [115](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=115) ^ref-42288

---
The plan for transforming the organization should be kept as small as possible to reduce complexity. — location: [133](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=133) ^ref-37803

---
Once the business objectives and continuous improvement process are in place, executives can start changing development processes by applying Agile and DevOps principles at scale. — location: [137](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=137) ^ref-7145

each new software project is new and unique, so there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the planning. — location: [142](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=142) ^ref-53249

ability of organizations to predict the effectiveness of software changes is so poor that literally 50% — location: [142](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=142) ^ref-45166

The DevOps approach of integrating working code across the organization in an operation-like environment is one of the biggest challenges for large, traditional organizations, but it provides the most significant improvements in aligning the work across teams. — location: [150](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=150) ^ref-26929

---
Executives play a key role in communicating the advantages of the latter approach and in explaining how it differs from what is typically done in the — location: [173](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=173) ^ref-10086

---
The goal of this approach is to structure the program such that you can determine the schedule, scope, and resources up front. — location: [179](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=179) ^ref-60272

---
Software development is such a discovery process that many of the assumptions made in the planning stage quickly become obsolete during development. — location: [182](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=182) ^ref-64813

---
Agile practitioners have numerous examples where after delivering less than 50% of the original must-have features, the customer is happy with the product and no longer requesting more features. — location: [190](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=190) ^ref-59505

---
Executives need to understand that the capacity of the organization to absorb change is the biggest constraint to rolling out these improvements. — location: [198](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=198) ^ref-19944

---
focus on the business breakthroughs the Agile principles are intended to achieve while taking into consideration the capacity of an organization to change. — location: [201](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=201) ^ref-11350

---
you want teams that can own the whole feature end to end, — location: [210](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=210) ^ref-38821

---
The problem most organizations have is that once they have determined the “right” way for their teams to do Agile, they feel the next step is teaching everyone one else to do it that way. — location: [228](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=228) ^ref-58035

---
Therefore, as leaders we feel it is important, wherever possible, to provide the framework with the objectives and let the team have as much design flexibility in — location: [235](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=235) ^ref-37600

---
defining how the work will get done. It provides them with more interesting work, and they take more ownership of the results. In addition, when the situation changes, those doing the work are likely to sense it and adapt more quickly than an executive would. — location: [236](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=236) ^ref-30802

---
because they focus on rolling out Agile teams the “right” way instead of applying Agile principles at scale. — location: [240](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=240) ^ref-42841

---
of an enterprise backlog and always-releasable code. — location: [241](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=241) ^ref-60245

---
Having the executives and managers leading the transformation by setting the business objectives and running the continuous improvement process engages them in the transformation. — location: [242](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=242) ^ref-19374

---
Providing a framework for prioritizing and integrating work across the teams provides the basic processes for improving the effectiveness of large organizations while providing the teams with as much flexibility as possible in defining how they work on a day-to-day basis. — location: [245](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=245) ^ref-57733

---
to try all the latest ideas without any clear reason why. — location: [254](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=254) ^ref-13077

---
This clear objective really helped guide our journey and prioritize the work along the way. — location: [260](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=260) ^ref-42528

---
develop a clear set of business objectives tuned to your specific organization to ensure you are well positioned to maximize the impact of the transformation on business results. — location: [261](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=261) ^ref-59258

---
struggle to show bottom-line business results to the CFO. — location: [264](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=264) ^ref-30616

---
Not having clear business objectives is a key source of the problem. — location: [265](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=265) ^ref-56372

---
Having a set of high-level business objectives that the entire organization is focused on is the only way to get this type of cross-organizational cooperation and partnership. — location: [272](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=272) ^ref-62910

---
You start with a clear understanding of how people are spending their time and the value the software is intended to provide to your business. This approach addresses the biggest cost and cycle-time drivers that are not key to your business objectives. — location: [279](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=279) ^ref-9455

---
that are typically the biggest sources of inefficiencies in most enterprise software development efforts: maintaining always-releasable code and your planning processes. — location: [283](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=283) ^ref-63657

---
Therefore, we started by understanding our cost and cycle-time drivers to identify waste in our development processes. — location: [290](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=290) ^ref-45477

---
so we wanted to make sure we began where we would get the biggest return on our investment. — location: [301](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=301) ^ref-14705

---
integrating it with everyone else, qualifying it, and getting it to the customer are dramatically different. In almost every large, traditional organization, this is by far the biggest opportunity for improvement. — location: [320](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=320) ^ref-22511

---
They also have an end-to-end view of the value chain and are best positioned to bring all the resources of the organization to bear on a common plan for improving the development processes. — location: [341](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=341) ^ref-40579

---
they must continuously engage with the organization and its people throughout the journey to get a qualitative feel for what is and isn’t working. — location: [343](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=343) ^ref-43449

---
It requires creating a culture of continuous improvement — location: [346](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=346) ^ref-45270

---
Enterprise-Level Iteration Objectives — location: [349](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=349) ^ref-58833

---
But for the executives, that level of detail is just too much noise, resulting in a strategy/plan that is an aggregate of details instead of a well-thought-out set of objectives. — location: [350](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=350) ^ref-47685

---
need to establish strategic objectives that make sense and that can be used to drive plans and track progress at the enterprise level. — location: [352](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=352) ^ref-59027

---
They also make sure the objectives are based on what the teams are actually doing and achieving. — location: [367](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=367) ^ref-52274

---
This kind of collaboration helps build a culture of trust. — location: [368](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=368) ^ref-42151

---
There was a website that aggregated all of our metrics and enabled tracking every objective down through the organization. — location: [377](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=377) ^ref-21935

---
As executives, we would each start the morning at our desks spending 30–45 minutes reviewing these metrics, so we were able to know exactly how we were doing meeting these objectives and could identify where we were struggling. — location: [379](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=379) ^ref-12077

---
The leadership team would then spend most of their days walking the floor trying to understand where we were struggling and why. — location: [381](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=381) ^ref-46818

---
one we encourage executives to embrace if this process is going to be successful. — location: [382](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=382) ^ref-60442

---
trying to understand what was working and what needed to be improved. — location: [383](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=383) ^ref-28347

---
The engineers began sharing their ideas and making their struggles visible because they realized that the executives were there to provide help and were willing to make changes. — location: [388](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=388) ^ref-31759

---
With this kind of trust comes transparency and with transparency comes a greater ability to fix issues quickly. As executives, we came to understand the importance of this culture shift. — location: [389](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=389) ^ref-4536

---
In about 20 minutes, we would create a rough draft of objectives for the next iteration. We say “rough draft” because we had not yet gotten the perspectives and support of the broader organization. — location: [395](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=395) ^ref-24224

---
We know that aligning the organization on enterprise iteration goals takes longer than most — location: [398](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=398) ^ref-4797

---
The point is that if you’re managing a construction project or a hardware design effort, you must do extensive requirements gathering and design work up front; otherwise, mistakes are very time-consuming and costly to fix. The — location: [426](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=426) ^ref-60949

---
First, we rob ourselves of software’s greatest benefit: flexibility. — location: [431](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=431) ^ref-13933

---
Waterfall model, many organizations will spend 20–30% or more of their entire capacity to do the requirement gathering and scheduling steps. — location: [436](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=436) ^ref-64787

---
Once the code starts coming together, the team learns a lot more about their assumptions and can better define their schedule for shorter time frames. — location: [458](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=458) ^ref-21657

---
planning processes is that this push eats up valuable capacity the organization could be using for identifying and delivering actual business value. — location: [460](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=460) ^ref-62462

---
If the analysis shows the development is going to take six months, then commit to the delivery in nine to twelve months. The other is to commit to the schedule and when it is not on track, just add resources and work the Development teams night and day on a death march until the program ships. — location: [466](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=466) ^ref-15461

---
Therefore, it makes more sense to capitalize on the flexibility of software and delay software feature decisions as late as possible so the commitment is made based on the most current understanding of the market. — location: [474](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=474) ^ref-24391

---
The planning process is used primarily to support different business decisions. — location: [480](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=480) ^ref-54637

---
So you should be clear about the decisions required and invest the least amount possible to obtain enough information to support these decisions. — location: [481](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=481) ^ref-6079

---
It should look across the organization so the most important things are being developed first. — location: [490](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=490) ^ref-52097

---
Otherwise, the individual teams are at risk of suboptimizing the system by developing capabilities the teams feel are important but are less important to the overall line of business they are supporting. — location: [491](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=491) ^ref-43615

---
initiatives to ensure the right overall business priorities are being developed first. — location: [493](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=493) ^ref-45299

---
When the planning was done and it was clear that not all the “MUST” features could be completed, we needed another planning cycle to prove the “MUST” features really couldn’t be delivered—because after all, they were “MUST” features. This vicious cycle was taking precious capacity away from a team that could have been delivering new capabilities and products. — location: [502](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=502) ^ref-7859

---
Additionally, we separated out the long-term manufacturing commitment requirements from the feature commitment decisions that could wait until later. — location: [510](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=510) ^ref-12297

---
This approach also gives the management team a quick view of where it makes the most sense to add capacity or move people across teams. — location: [529](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=529) ^ref-17036

---
Again, in this case you don’t want to get locked into firm commitments for 100% of the capacity. So if the long-range plan committed to less than 50% of the capacity, this medium-range commitment should bring the total capacity used up to maybe 80%. — location: [531](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=531) ^ref-44550

---
First, the investment in breaking the requirements down into more detail was delayed until we knew they would get prioritized for development. — location: [558](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=558) ^ref-2976

---
The net result of all these changes is that planning went from taking ~20% of the organization’s capacity down to less than 5%, freeing up an extra 15% of the capacity to focus on delivering business value. — location: [561](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=561) ^ref-32668

---
First, the planning process should be broken down into different planning horizons to support the business decisions required for different time frames. — location: [570](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=570) ^ref-10431

---
Second, if the items that must have long-term commitments require more than 50% of your capacity, you should look for architectural and process improvements so that those commitments are not a major capacity driver. — location: [571](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=571) ^ref-40654

---
Lastly you should consider moving to just-in-time creation of requirements detail to minimize the risk of rework and investment — location: [575](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=575) ^ref-16468

---
requirements that will never get prioritized for development. — location: [576](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=576) ^ref-19121

---
don’t allow you to economically release small batches of new functionality, then you are not able to realize these full benefits of software. — location: [589](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=589) ^ref-24366

---
lose the benefits of receiving rapid feedback — location: [590](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=590) ^ref-50138

---
has been so overlooked by these organizations that new practices called DevOps and Continuous Delivery (CD) have begun to emerge to address this gap. — location: [593](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=593) ^ref-35374

---
Applying these concepts at scale is typically the source of the biggest breakthroughs in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of software development in large organizations, — location: [596](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=596) ^ref-46872

---
CD tends to cover all the technical approaches for improving code releases and DevOps tends to be focused on the cultural changes. — location: [601](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=601) ^ref-45593

---

---
1. Improve the quality and speed of feedback for developers — location: [607](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=607) ^ref-14494

---
If this feedback takes days or weeks to get to them, it is of limited value to the developers’ learning. — location: [609](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=609) ^ref-63813

---
there is a real-time process that helps them improve. — location: [613](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=613) ^ref-26514

---
Therefore, as much as possible you want to ensure the feedback is coming from testing in an environment that is as much like production as possible. — location: [616](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=616) ^ref-26545

---
The Operations team can ensure their concerns are addressed by starting to add their release criteria to these test environments. The Development teams then start to learn about and correct issues that would occur in production because they are getting this feedback on a daily basis when it is easy to fix. Executives must ensure that both Development and Operations make the cultural shift of using the same tools and automation to build, test, and deploy if the transformation is going to be successful. — location: [618](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=618) ^ref-55604

---
The work in this phase of the program is focused on finding and fixing defects to bring the code base up to release quality. — location: [625](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=625) ^ref-16930

---
Reducing this time requires automating your entire regression suite and implementing all-new testing so that it can be run every day during the development phase to provide rapid feedback to the developers. — location: [626](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=626) ^ref-2682

support delivery of the highest-priority features on a regular cadence defined by the business instead of one defined by the development — location: [634](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=634) ^ref-55067

---
It needs to be a structured, repeatable process, or you are going to end up wasting lots of time and resources chasing issues you can’t find and/or trying to localize the offending code in a large, — location: [643](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=643) ^ref-58468

Develop an automated deployment process that will enable you to quickly and efficiently find any deployment or environment issues — location: [646](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=646) ^ref-55398

but the duplicate work associated with multiple branches is a huge inefficiency in most large software — location: [660](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=660) ^ref-39808

---
Every time you see a branch that lasts more than a couple of days, you should think of it as duplicate costs in the system impacting the inherent economical benefits of your software. — location: [660](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=660) ^ref-11660

development practices like versioning services, rearchitecture through abstraction, feature flags, and evolutionary database design techniques. — location: [688](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=688) ^ref-39953

---
The first was that if you were going to commit code, you were required to stick around until the build was complete with the automated acceptance tests passing (green). — location: [706](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=706) ^ref-15076

---
The second rule was making sure people were not continuing to commit code into a broken (red) build. — location: [709](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=709) ^ref-9582

---
We did this by creating gated commits or auto-revert. — location: [715](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=715) ^ref-10638

---
Both work, but we would recommend taking the time to setup auto-revert or gated commits to drive this change. — location: [732](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=732) ^ref-59707

---
While technology can help, if the executives are not willing to lead and drive cultural changes like developing on trunk, then no amount of technology is going provide the necessary breakthroughs. — location: [751](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=751) ^ref-18210

or subsystem tests. The second is build and the ability to manage different artifacts as independent components. The third is test automation. — location: [768](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=768) ^ref-32274

have architectures that enable them to quickly develop, test, and deploy components of large systems independently. — location: [775](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=775) ^ref-37750

Ideally traditional organizations would clean up the architecture first, so that they could have the same benefits of working with smaller, faster-moving independent teams. — location: [779](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=779) ^ref-62679

challenge is to isolate the product variation so as much of the code as possible can be leveraged unchanged across the product line. — location: [789](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=789) ^ref-53395

---

The best approach for automated testing is to pair a really good development architect that knows the fundamentals of object-oriented programing with a QA engineer that knows how code is manually tested in the current environment. — location: [855](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B012P0D4YG&location=855) ^ref-22865

First, due to their tightly coupled architectures, traditional organizations are not able to effectively find most of the defects with unit tests.
