description: "In Lean Software Development, Mary and Tom Poppendieck identify seven fundamental &quot;lean&quot; principles, adapt them for the world of software development, and show how they can serve as the foundation for agile development approaches that work. Along the way, they introduce 22 &quot;thinking tools&quot; that can help you customize the right agile practices for any environment. Better, cheaper, faster software development. You can have all three - if you adopt the same lean principles that have already revolutionized manufacturing, logistics, and product development: Iterating toward excellence: software development as an exercise in discovery; managing uncertainty: &quot;decide as late as possible&quot; by building change into the system; compressing the value stream: rapid development, feedback, and improvement; empowering teams and individuals without compromising coordination; software with integrity, promoting coherence, usability, fitness, maintainability, and adaptability; and how to &quot;see the whole&quot; - even when your developers are scattered across multiple locations and contractors. Simply put, Lean Software Development helps you refocus development on value, flow, and people - so you can achieve breakthrough quality, savings, speed, and business alignment."
