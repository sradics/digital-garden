## Highlights
the release is the moment of truth—the only time that we really learn about how our product fits the user’s needs! — location: [276](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=276) ^ref-21100

---
find a way to “slice the elephant,” — location: [288](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=288) ^ref-50128

---
addition to the bimonthly feature releases, we made small “patch” releases every few weeks — location: [297](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=297) ^ref-60655

---
We called them feature areas, which roughly equates to what agile folks would call epics. This list was used for high-level scheduling and release planning. — location: [301](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=301) ^ref-21885

---
we had a group of pilot users in Östergötland (a region in southern part of Sweden) — location: [308](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=308) ^ref-18526

---
In fact, collocation may well have been the most important success factor of this project. — location: [319](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=319) ^ref-59230

---
Some people are outside of the team structure to handle specialist functions and coordination functions. This includes the project manager, project administrator, configuration manager, e-learning specialist, performance test expert, development manager, coach, and so on. — location: [322](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=322) ^ref-10776

---
is, each team is collocated, cross-functional, self-organized, and capable of developing and testing a whole feature. — location: [324](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=324) ^ref-22192

---
Teams also tended to focus on getting their part of the work done instead of the whole product. For example, a requirements analyst would consider his work for a feature “done” when the requirements document had been written and signed off, instead of staying with that feature all the way through to production. — location: [340](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=340) ^ref-23770

---
cross-functional teams of analysts, testers, and developers sitting together. — location: [343](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=343) ^ref-7781

---
At precisely 9:45, a second set of daily stand-ups takes place, during which the members of each specialty (requirements analysis, test, development) meet separately to synchronize their work across all feature teams. — location: [364](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=364) ^ref-22720

---
Which team is doing what today? What is blocking our flow right now? Where is the bottleneck, and how can we alleviate it? — location: [396](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=396) ^ref-9520

---
Does anybody not know what to do today? — location: [397](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=397) ^ref-57705

---
Many problems that would otherwise result in the creation of documents and process rules are resolved directly at these morning meetings. — location: [413](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=413) ^ref-28161

---
handful of more detailed feature cards in the third column. So, the epic cards never make it past the second column, and the feature cards are born in the third column. — location: [431](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=431) ^ref-62102

---
There’s a big difference, though. In a waterfall model, the requirements are all completed before development starts, and development is completed before testing starts. — location: [449](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=449) ^ref-48521

---
In a Kanban system, these phases are all going on in parallel. While one set of features is being acceptance-tested by users, another set of features is being system tested, — location: [450](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=450) ^ref-54786

---
Having slack in the system not only enables fast flow, it also enables escalation. — location: [480](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=480) ^ref-43324

---
The date on the sticky indicates how long it has been up there, and the name indicates who is focusing on solving the issue (so we know who to ask about it). — location: [499](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=499) ^ref-64824

---
The speed of a project is largely determined by how well everyone understands what’s going — location: [512](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=512) ^ref-28538

---
However, we were missing the big picture. What’s going in the whole project? Where’s the bottleneck right now? — location: [515](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=515) ^ref-19942

---
So, we decided to have a two-layer system of boards—one shared project board plus three team boards. — location: [524](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=524) ^ref-1069

---
Most team members focus on their team-level board, while team leads and managers focus on both the team-level board and the project-level board. — location: [546](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=546) ^ref-20625

---
As time passes, more and more team members have started showing interest in the project-level board, which is a good indicator that people are focusing on the big picture rather than just on their own work. — location: [548](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=548) ^ref-50599

---
The goal statement acts as a guiding light. Sometimes we need to make difficult trade-offs, and having a clear, high-level goal helps everyone stay in sync about what’s important for the next release. — location: [557](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=557) ^ref-36043

---
Remove an impediment (“Let’s buy a new build server to replace the broken one!”) Help a bottleneck (“Let’s all do testing today!”) Reduce scope (“If we remove feature X from this release, we can still reach the goal!”) Adjust the goal (“This goal is no longer realistic; let’s define a new goal that we actually believe in!”) Work harder (“Who can come in on Saturday?”) — location: [565](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=565) ^ref-38888

---
Armed with this data, we can make a simple and realistic release plan that doesn’t try to hide the uncertainty: — location: [578](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=578) ^ref-17193

---
avoid death marches (projects where everyone knows they’re going to fail but still keep marching dutifully). — location: [582](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=582) ^ref-28171

---
Conversely, if people don’t understand the goal or don’t believe the goal is achievable, they will unconsciously disassociate themselves from the business goal and focus on personal goals such as “have fun coding” or “just get my part of the work done and go home.” — location: [584](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=584) ^ref-17309

---
The two most important definitions for us are definition of ready for development and definition of ready for system test, since that’s where we used to have the most problems. — location: [591](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=591) ^ref-33075

---
These documents are accessible on the project wiki — location: [598](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=598) ^ref-17388

---
but we eventually moved to Concordion. — location: [621](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=621) ^ref-39288

---
Demonstrated: The team has demonstrated this feature to the rest of the team, the on-site user, the requirements analyst, the system tester, and the usability expert. This helps us catch usability issues early so they don’t show up in system test or (even worse) user acceptance test. — location: [625](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=625) ^ref-51836

---
This is the basis of the stable trunk model we use — location: [632](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=632) ^ref-38456

---
In general, writing a definition of ready at the top of each key column is one of those simple techniques that is useful in any kind of Kanban system. — location: [648](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=648) ^ref-52359

---
“Next Five Tech Stories” section (right below “Next Ten Features”). These are essentially two parallel input queues to development. — location: [656](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=656) ^ref-54712

---
order. Instead, we do a form of “just in time” prioritization by continuously identifying the next ten features and next five tech stories. — location: [659](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=659) ^ref-54028

---
It may seem more effective to do test only at the end, but if we include bug-fixing time in the equation, it is significantly less effective. — location: [704](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=704) ^ref-29212

---
The bug-fixing time is reduced because we’ve already found and fixed many of the bugs earlier and because the bugs we do find at the end will tend to be newer bugs and therefore easier for the developers to find and fix. — location: [711](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=711) ^ref-36362

---
Even though it probably will never be fixed, most people seem to feel some sort of psychological comfort in writing it down. Plus it might be useful for data mining purposes—for example, to generate statistics showing which parts of the system are most bug-riddled. — location: [724](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=724) ^ref-14345

---
Finding and fixing bugs earlier is more effective than finding and fixing bugs later. Face-to-face communication is more effective than written communication (because of the higher bandwidth). Everybody learns more, as developers and testers learn about each other’s work. Less time is wasted managing long lists of old bugs. — location: [731](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=731) ^ref-63898

---
Now we have a hard limit of thirty. — location: [738](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=738) ^ref-23942

---
Blocker in this case means “The feature won’t be releasable with this bug” or “This bug is more important to fix than building additional features.” Write it on a pink sticky note and fix it now, like any other impediment. Don’t put it in a queue. — location: [739](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=739) ^ref-12442

---
this bug more important than any of the other top thirty bugs in the bug tracker?” If so, then that other bug is removed from the top thirty list to make room for this one. If not, then we ignore the new bug. — location: [742](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=742) ^ref-65144

---
“Next Ten Features,” “Next Five Tech Stories,” and “Next Five Bugs.” — location: [750](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=750) ^ref-25255

---
The important question is how the bugs get into the system in the first place—what underlying process problem is causing the technical problem? — location: [769](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=769) ^ref-33164

---
defect prevention meeting, where they take one of the recurring bugs and do a root-cause analysis. — location: [775](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=775) ^ref-541

---
they are a symptom. Bugs in your product are a symptom of bugs in your process. If you focus on fixing your process, you’ll dramatically reduce the number of new bugs in your product. — location: [796](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=796) ^ref-14360

---
and at the cross-team level. — location: [807](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=807) ^ref-21527

---
Track some simple metrics that show us whether our process is improving. We measure velocity and cycle time — location: [807](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=807) ^ref-588

---
If everyone knows where we are going and where we are right now and if we have the right communication forums in place, then chances are people will self-organize to move in the right direction and continuously figure out ways of getting there faster. — location: [811](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=811) ^ref-49819

---
process improvement workshop, — location: [816](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=816) ^ref-28585

---
Bringing in a team-external facilitator from time to time is usually a good idea because that gives the team some variation in how the retrospective is run and provides the team lead with insights about different ways to run retrospectives. — location: [819](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=819) ^ref-2173

---
One of my most important tasks as coach was to set up and facilitate these process improvement workshops until they became part of the culture. — location: [834](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=834) ^ref-46451

---
This felt more humane. Now we could spend ninety minutes without feeling as stressed (since it wasn’t every week), and it was easier to implement a change and see results before the next meeting. — location: [849](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=849) ^ref-27415

---
And the nice thing about gut feel is that it often is a leading indicator of a problem that’s about to occur, while hard metrics often show a problem only after it has occurred. So yes, we use — location: [878](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=878) ^ref-14546

---
But we use metrics primarily to support process improvement, not to drive it. — location: [881](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=881) ^ref-56859

---
propose some research that will bring useful metrics to the next process improvement workshop, or plan a separate problem-solving workshop to be done with a small focus team. — location: [886](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=886) ^ref-331

---
most obvious advantages and disadvantages. Quite often this quick analysis clearly reveals which option is best, so we agree on implementing that option. — location: [890](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=890) ^ref-51069

---
Everybody doesn’t have to like that option, but everyone will accept and support it. That’s what consensus means. — location: [909](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=909) ^ref-32641

---
we pick one at random, pick the easiest one, or do a quick tie-breaker vote — location: [914](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=914) ^ref-47008

---
By aiming for 100 percent consensus for each change (that is, 100 percent of the people present at the workshop), we dramatically reduce the risk of resistance and thereby dramatically increase the likelihood that the change will work. So, the few extra minutes spent on consensus building pays off in a big way. — location: [921](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=921) ^ref-60408

---
Just stick to this rule of thumb: “When in doubt, choose the simplest solution.” — location: [965](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=965) ^ref-57812

---
We highlight buffer columns by writing “Queue” in red next to the column title. — location: [975](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=975) ^ref-1955

---
we need a buffer to absorb the variability. — location: [984](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=984) ^ref-62893

---
To aid in this process, we have team magnets on the project board. A team can tag a feature in the Next 10 list (or earlier in the workflow) with their team magnet, indicating that “This feature would be best done by our team.” That way, people know who to talk to about that feature, and the other teams will think twice before pulling in that feature. — location: [1004](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1004) ^ref-46580

---
The WIP limit of five for each development team applies across both columns, “Development in Progress” and “Ready for System Test.” — location: [1028](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1028) ^ref-60262

---
That’s why we don’t include tech stories in the WIP limit, because we want to encourage team members to work on tech stories when the WIP limit is full. — location: [1036](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1036) ^ref-4076

---
When measuring cycle time and calculating velocity, we include only feature cards — location: [1040](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1040) ^ref-22922

---
We track two process metrics: Velocity (features per week) Cycle time (weeks per feature) — location: [1052](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1052) ^ref-26543

---
theory, yes. In practice, however, the feature sizes turned out to be quite evenly distributed. — location: [1078](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1078) ^ref-40734

---
The higher level of precision gave no added value, so estimating in story points would have been a waste of time. — location: [1088](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1088) ^ref-54337

---
“How long did it take for feature X to move from “Next Ten Features” to “Ready for Acceptance Test.” — location: [1091](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1091) ^ref-51111

---
We measure cycle time only up to “Ready for Acceptance Test” because that’s the part of the workflow we can control (and hence optimize). — location: [1098](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1098) ^ref-57091

---
We then visualize this using a control chart, where the height of each bar represents how long one specific feature took to cross the board. This graph is useful for predicting how long it will take for a feature to get done. It’s also a great way to generate a sense of horrified awe, because most people don’t realize how long things really take! It happens — location: [1103](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1103) ^ref-43822

---
five to ten times longer than the actual worked time. — location: [1107](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1107) ^ref-55167

---
It turned out that size wasn’t the main factor influencing cycle time; other factors such as focus and access to key people were more important. — location: [1116](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1116) ^ref-59142

---
This by the way is known as Little’s law[6] in queuing theory. It is inescapable. — location: [1129](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1129) ^ref-44299

---
OK, that reduction isn’t by a factor of 3, but it’s still a significant reduction. When reducing WIP, you need to take into account that, if you reduce it too much, you’ll see other side effects such as having lots of people with nothing to do. That in turn negatively impacts velocity and thereby increases cycle time again. So, you have to find a balance. The goal is to — location: [1133](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1133) ^ref-287

---
This gives us very interesting data such as “Hey, feature X was only two days of work but took twenty days to cross the board! That’s only 10 percent process cycle efficiency!” — location: [1164](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1164) ^ref-58700

---
Most companies are in the 10–15 percent range unless they specifically optimize for this. Trying — location: [1165](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1165) ^ref-58615

---
Backlog grooming is all about getting features to the “Ready for Development” state (see Chapter 7, ​Defining Ready and Done​). — location: [1175](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1175) ^ref-39837

---
Then we break the group into small cross-functional subgroups, typically with one requirements analyst, one developer, and one tester in each. Each subgroup takes a few feature cards, estimates them using Planning Poker (see Chapter 19, ​Sizing the Backlog with Planning Poker​), and writes S, M, or L on the card (representing — location: [1179](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1179) ^ref-23170

---
“Out of everything in the whole world that we might focus on next, what are the top ten features?” — location: [1187](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1187) ^ref-55080

---
Business value—which features will the customers be happiest to see? Knowledge—which features will generate knowledge (and thereby reduce risk)? Resource utilization—we want a balance of feature areas so that each team has stuff to work on. Dependencies—which features are best built together? Testability—which features are most logical to test together and should therefore be developed in close proximity to each other? — location: [1189](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1189) ^ref-29298

---
As a result of the conversation, that feature would be broken down, estimated, and given an acceptance test. — location: [1198](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1198) ^ref-48744

---
We don’t know exactly what our velocity will be in the future, but it is probably safe to assume that it will be in the range of three to five features per week, on average. — location: [1202](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1202) ^ref-13851

---
we can give a realistic answer—as long as we know the number of features. The — location: [1205](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1205) ^ref-7581

---
However, for long-term planning that logic doesn’t hold, — location: [1209](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1209) ^ref-2159

---
The solution is simple. Take each epic and estimate how many features it will break into. — location: [1211](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1211) ^ref-58012

---
The process is similar to estimating in story points; we are just asking “How many features is this epic?” instead of “How many story points?” — location: [1212](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1212) ^ref-23636

---
One lesson we’ve learned is that we should have gotten our version control system in shape before we scaled from thirty to sixty people. For long periods our version control system had seriously — location: [1224](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1224) ^ref-63161

---
“Agile Version Control with Multiple Teams.”[7] That change was a bumpy ride, but it certainly helped us get things into order! — location: [1228](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1228) ^ref-22503

---
Now, since we’re all human, we sometimes make mistakes and check in things that break the trunk. That’s OK, as long as the mistakes are discovered quickly and fixed (or rolled back). — location: [1238](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1238) ^ref-45752

---
Our continuous integration system continuously monitors the trunk and runs builds and tests whenever something is checked — location: [1239](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1239) ^ref-63498

---
Each team has a team branch that they use to check in and share code during development — location: [1242](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1242) ^ref-62598

---
The code has to compile, and all unit tests have to pass, but the feature doesn’t have to be finished or tested. — location: [1243](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1243) ^ref-30418

---
Every morning the team leads merge down any changes from the trunk to their team branch, handling any merge conflicts immediately. — location: [1248](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A32O00Q&location=1248) ^ref-3644

---

Ignore the problem. Let the system decline into entropy death, and hope that nobody needs it by then. Rebuild the system from scratch using test-driven development to ensure good test coverage.

Here’s an approach that I like: List your test cases. Classify each test by risk, how expensive it is to do manually, and how expensive it is to automate. Sort the list in priority order.

Sometimes a helpful diagram can turn into a rat’s maze. In that case, you need to simplify it. Here are some techniques: Remove redundant boxes (boxes that don’t add much value to the diagram). Focus on “depth first” rather than “breadth first.” Don’t write down all causes of a problem; write only the most important one or two, and then keep digging deeper. Accept imperfections: a diagram like this will never be perfect. George Box puts it nicely: “All models are wrong, but some are useful.” Maybe your problem area is too broad. Try to limit yourself to a more narrowly defined problem.
