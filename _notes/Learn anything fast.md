Learning how to learn changes everything. 

Here's why most people stay stuck while others achieve 10 goals in the time it takes the average person to achieve one

â€”â€”â€”

The problem? Most people try to acquire skills as a whole.

It's like trying to learn to swim by reading books about swimming technique while standing on the pool deck.

You know what actually works?

Remember your first swimming lessons? It was a composed learning approach. Arm movement. Leg movement. Head positioning. Then you combined it all.


A current skill I want to learn is to become a better writer. In the beginning I was paralysed by the abstract topic of better writing. So I broke it down.

Here's the exact system I used to become a better writer:

â†’ Start with your deeper why
Why do I want to learn to write? Because I can express my thoughts clearly and persuasively.

But why does that matter? Because I can explain the problem of using outdated learning approaches and offer my solution for smarter learning.

â†’ Find resources that teach the core mechanics

I found Simple Marketing for Smart People that explains making an argument as the foundation of effective writing.

I discovered Dan Koe and Kieran Drew as gifted writers. Bought their courses and started applying their lessons immediately.

â†’ Do the thing. Practice with intention

I started writing my weekly newsletter and several LinkedIn posts each week. Daily practice. Real lessons applied. Plus AI assistants to mentor and coach me along the way.

The secret ingredient? PUREFOCUS. Complete immersion in the topic with zero distractions. This deep engagement boosts retention and understanding as you fully engage mentally and emotionally with the material. (Thanks to Dan Koe for describing that so clearly in his recent newsletter).

â†’ Leverage tactical stress as a form of engineering your environment. 

For me, this isn't just practiceâ€”it's how I build my business. Writing a newsletter and being present on LinkedIn grows my personal brand.

With the intention to cut through the noise and help experienced professionals like you translate their hard-won wisdom into future-proof relevance and authentic impact.

What skill have you been putting off because it feels too abstract to tackle? Ready to break it down into learnable components?
