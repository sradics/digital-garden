## Highlights
The most important attitude that can be formed is that of desire to go on learning. — location: [145](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=145) ^ref-12125

many teams that have “gone agile” report great results: they build better software, work together better, — location: [155](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=155) ^ref-42639

satisfy their users, and do it all while having a much more relaxed and enjoyable working environment. — location: [156](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=156) ^ref-63690

---
Agile is a set of methods and methodologies that help your team to think more effectively, work more efficiently, and make better decisions. — location: [165](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=165) ^ref-44973

---
An agile mindset is about opening up planning, design, and process improvement to the entire team. An — location: [174](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=174) ^ref-15638

---
He has to work very hard to stay on top of everyone on the team, so that he can make adjustments to the plan and help them deal with their problems. — location: [197](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=197) ^ref-17483

---
For example, what would happen if the project manager felt like everyone on the team worked together to plan the project? Then the project manager would genuinely listen to each team member, not just to find out how they’ve deviated from his plan, but to understand how the plan that everyone on the team worked together to create might need to change. — location: [212](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=212) ^ref-7705

---
but about understanding how the project is going, and coming together every day to find ways that everyone can work better? — location: [219](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=219) ^ref-17862

---
But if everyone on the team shares the mindset that the daily standup is their way of making sure that everyone is on track, they’re all working toward the same goal, and they all have a say in how the project is run, it becomes much more effective — and also more satisfying. — location: [228](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=228) ^ref-13923

---
understand the ideas that drive effective agile teams, and the values and principles that bring them together. — location: [259](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=259) ^ref-6108

---
We want you to understand the most popular agile schools of thought — Scrum, XP, Lean, and Kanban — and how they can all be agile, even though they’re very different from each other. — location: [260](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=260) ^ref-39814

---
If it’s an idea that you already understand in depth, then you’ll recognize the simplification and react to it emotionally — and that keeps you engaged. On the other hand, if you aren’t aware of the concept, it helps give you a gentler introduction to prepare you for the more in-depth description later on. — location: [306](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=306) ^ref-719

---
cognitive research1 that shows that your brain remembers more when you feel like you’re in a conversation. — location: [316](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=316) ^ref-14933

---
Agile, as a movement, is different from any approach to software development that came before it, because it started with ideas, values, and principles that embody a mindset. — location: [396](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=396) ^ref-36768

---
Teams that successfully adopt agile build better, higher quality software products, and they do it faster than before. — location: [402](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=402) ^ref-29969

---
four core values that are common to successful teams and their projects, which they called the  Manifesto for Agile Software Development: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools Working software over comprehensive documentation Customer collaboration over contract negotiation Responding to change over following a plan — location: [416](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=416) ^ref-24153

---
Many agile practitioners refer to this as “big requirements up front” (sometimes abbreviated BRUF). — location: [443](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=443) ^ref-43879

---
their project’s problems were caused by overly rigid documentation, poor communication, and bugs, which led to projects that could not keep up with normal project changes. — location: [472](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=472) ^ref-25996

---
Fred Brooks’s 1986 essay, “No Silver Bullet,” in which he shows conclusively why this is an impossible goal. — location: [482](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=482) ^ref-34053

---
Waterfall really can work. In fact, if you actually know what you need up front, then writing it down first is a pretty efficient way to build software. — location: [497](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=497) ^ref-15030

---
when waterfall projects are run effectively, it’s because their teams take to heart many of the same values, principles, and practices that agile projects follow. — location: [516](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=516) ^ref-48320

---
To Joanna, agile specifically meant “the ability for a project to handle changes,” — location: [563](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=563) ^ref-63317

---
But they didn’t have that conversation, and the project ran into the same kind of problems their past waterfall projects ran into: developers making incorrect assumptions, jumping into programming, and having to make changes to the code that could have been avoided, and that leave it more fragile. — location: [683](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=683) ^ref-65453

---
When each person thinks only about his role and that one particular way the user story helps him, and doesn’t look past it to see how the entire team uses the user story — or any other agile tool, technique, or practice — it can cause exactly the kind of problem that Dan and Tom ran into. We call this a fractured perspective, because everyone has a different view of the agile practice. — location: [685](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=685) ^ref-18635

---
But when people on a team don’t communicate — like when a developer builds code and throws it “over the wall” to a product owner without ever really talking about what the users need — it can lead to problems that need to be corrected, often more than once. — location: [696](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=696) ^ref-33688

---
In other words, when the team doesn’t communicate, the people in each of the project roles can adopt a new tool (user stories), but still hold onto the old attitudes that caused friction and team problems. — location: [712](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=712) ^ref-24156

---
Figure 2-2. Individual team members tend to add agile practices in areas of the project that they’re already good at, so the team only improves in those areas — and that’s why a fractured perspective leads to better-than-not-doing-it results. — location: [744](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=744) ^ref-31755

---
Better communication helps a team manage change better. Planning as a team is more important than over-documenting a plan and mindlessly following it. — location: [752](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=752) ^ref-13002

---
that support this principle, across lots of different ways of thinking about agile. That’s why you’ll see practices that support individuals and interactions — like daily standup meetings and retrospectives (where everyone talks about how the project or iteration went, and what lessons can be learned) — throughout this book. — location: [786](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=786) ^ref-53142

---
And user stories, too — the stories themselves are less important than the fact that they help the team have a conversation about what the story means. — location: [788](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=788) ^ref-8312

---
To an agile practitioner, working software is software that adds value to the organization. — location: [800](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=800) ^ref-50234

---
Documentation is only a means toward that end. — location: [803](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=803) ^ref-35621

---
managers all work on different teams, and don’t really collaborate toward a single goal of delivering working software, they often treat each other as if they’re working on a contract. — location: [818](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=818) ^ref-56399

---
That’s why teams need to constantly look for changes, and to make sure that they respond appropriately when there’s a change in what the users need, or in how the software needs to be built. — location: [831](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=831) ^ref-16843

---
Without concrete practices, principles are sterile; but without principles, practices have no life, no character, no heart. Great products arise from great teams — teams who are principled, who have character, who have heart, who have persistence, and who have courage.6 — location: [860](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=860) ^ref-56212

---
A team whose members only see the practices and don’t think about the principles will miss out on the important interactions between people. — location: [915](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=915) ^ref-53275

---
But even more important than specific practices are the individuals and interactions. — location: [921](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=921) ^ref-47938

---
It’s these values (along with the 12 principles, which you’ll learn about in Chapter 3) that show us how the practices work together, and serve as a guide for how teams adopt those practices. — location: [922](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=922) ^ref-14224

Values and principles provide guidance towards agility.practices have to be used having the values and principles in mind

---
Adopting a methodology in full means you’ll be following a tried-and-true path that takes you from the beginning to the end of a software project, without the trial and error that can lead to a fractured perspective. — location: [930](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=930) ^ref-43802

---
An agile methodology is a collection of practices combined with ideas, advice, and often a body of knowledge and wealth of experience among agile practitioners. — location: [933](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=933) ^ref-37866

---
both iterative. This means that the project is divided up into iterations, in which the team performs all of the activities of a complete project to produce working, deployable software at the end of each iteration. — location: [979](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=979) ^ref-17116

---
Lean is not a methodology.  Rather, it’s a name for a mindset — it has its own set of values, and thinking tools to help — location: [990](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=990) ^ref-12559

---
Kanban is an agile method for improving the way that a team builds software. It’s built on the values of Lean, and it includes its own practices to help a team improve and evolve. — location: [993](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=993) ^ref-42895

---
The values and principles of the Agile Manifesto are what tie all methodologies and methods together. — location: [1000](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1000) ^ref-41393

---
An agile methodology is a collection of practices combined with ideas, advice, and a community of practitioners. — location: [1026](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1026) ^ref-8555

---
Write down a list of all of the practices that you and your team use when you build software. — location: [1079](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1079) ^ref-48383

---
Ask someone else on your team to write down her own list of all of the practices that you and your team use. Compare your lists. What practices are on one list but not the other? — location: [1082](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1082) ^ref-14544

---
Ask individual team members specifically about the values in the Agile Manifesto: what they think of them, which ones they consider important, or if they think the values apply to them at all. — location: [1095](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1095) ^ref-61096

---
Bring up this concept directly, and ask team members to come up with examples of practices that feel “empty,” or that take a lot of effort with little payoff. — location: [1097](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1097) ^ref-13285

we’ve gathered these principles into four sections — delivery, communication, execution, and improvement — because they represent consistent themes throughout the principles and agile in general. — location: [1136](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1136) ^ref-13248

their most important job is to deliver working software to their customers. — location: [1208](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1208) ^ref-13468

---
But how does that translate to the day-to-day work of a team? — location: [1210](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1210) ^ref-13556

---
This first principle includes three distinct and important ideas: releasing software early, delivering value continuously, and satisfying the customer. — location: [1215](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1215) ^ref-44210

---
When there’s not a great partnership between the team and the people they build software for, if the team delivers incomplete software, the users and stakeholders may judge it very harshly and even panic if a feature they expect to see is missing. The core agile values have an answer to this: customer collaboration over contract negotiation. — location: [1236](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1236) ^ref-57254

Agile Processes Harness Change for the Customer’s Competitive Advantage. — location: [1249](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1249) ^ref-57146

---
pride of workmanship: we want to deliver products that we can stand behind, and that satisfy our users’ needs. A change in a project threatens that, because it’s questioning the path that you’ve taken and the assumptions that you’ve made. — location: [1263](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1263) ^ref-12356

---
The first step toward welcoming changing requirements is to try to see things from the customer’s perspective. — location: [1270](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1270) ^ref-60289

---
Coming to you and requesting the change is, to him, admitting that he made a mistake — a mistake that will cost you a lot of work. — location: [1273](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1273) ^ref-2818

---
That’s not easy to do. No wonder customers often wait a long time before coming to the team with a change! — location: [1274](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1274) ^ref-26862

Interesting aspect that changes get delayed because of feeling ashamed

two people are being asked to do the impossible. You’re being asked to read the customer’s mind. He’s being asked to predict the future. — location: [1277](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1277) ^ref-65128

---
it’s better for the company to allow us to make mistakes and correct them frequently, rather than expect us to do things perfectly the first time. — location: [1282](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1282) ^ref-8122

This matches the drawing game

---
We stop thinking of changes as mistakes. We did our best with the information we had at the time, and it only became clear that we were wrong because the decisions we made along the way gave us the perspective to recognize the changes that we have to make today. — location: [1287](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1287) ^ref-2057

---
Project managers constantly monitor for these changes, and then control the project by evaluating each change as it occurs, updating the plans to incorporate the change into the schedule and documentation, giving the team new assignments, and managing their stakeholders’ expectations so that nobody is blindsided. — location: [1312](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1312) ^ref-40481

---
The key to welcoming changes without introducing chaos lies in delivering working software frequently. — location: [1320](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1320) ^ref-53552

---
The predictable schedule and the constant checkpoints help the team catch those changes early, and give everyone a blame-free environment where they can discuss each change and come up with a strategy to incorporate it into the project. — location: [1324](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1324) ^ref-58453

The 12 principles of agile development that accompany the Agile Manifesto provide agile practitioners with direction and insight into practices and methodologies. — location: [1367](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1367) ^ref-57629

how much documentation should they create? The answer, for an agile team, is just enough to build the project. — location: [1390](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1390) ^ref-21058

It all depends on what works best for the team, and that’s one of the freedoms that agile gives you. — location: [1397](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1397) ^ref-43689

Principle #4: The Most Efficient and Effective Method of Conveying Information To and Within a Development Team Is Face-To-Face Conversation. — location: [1418](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1418) ^ref-44066

---
Agile practitioners recognize that documentation is just another form of communication. — location: [1420](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1420) ^ref-5787

---
The goal is to make sure that the ideas in my head match the ideas in your head as closely as possible. — location: [1422](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1422) ^ref-19657

---
When a group of people look at the world the same way, and communicate about both positive and negative ideas openly, they end up with a shared perspective. — location: [1440](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1440) ^ref-55582

---
The closer the team gets to having a sense of community and a shared perspective, the more often each person will independently come to a similar answer when posed the same question. — location: [1445](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1445) ^ref-28455

---
But the businesspeople don’t want to spend all of their time with the software team, because they have jobs to get back to. So who wins? Agile teams have a way past this problem that lets both the businesspeople and the developers win together. They start with an understanding that the team is delivering valuable software to the company. — location: [1461](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1461) ^ref-58044

---
A good project should be valuable enough that the businesspeople can see that it’s worth the effort they’ll need to put in over the course of the project. — location: [1465](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1465) ^ref-44819

---
This is why teams that deliver working software frequently should prioritize the most valuable features first — so the businesspeople can get that value delivered early. — location: [1473](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1473) ^ref-30142

---
the agile team collaborates with the customer (typically the product owner) as someone with an equal say in the way the project is run. — location: [1476](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1476) ^ref-61880

A good team works to make sure that everyone — team members, managers, stakeholders, and customers — really understands where the project is at any time. — location: [1559](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1559) ^ref-55406

So how do you report progress, if status reports aren’t good enough? The answer lies in working software. — location: [1572](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1572) ^ref-28633

---
By delivering working software at the end of each iteration, and by doing a real product demonstration that shows everyone exactly what the team did, they keep everyone up to date on the progress of the software in a way that is almost impossible to misread. — location: [1579](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1579) ^ref-33063

Iterative development makes this more realistic, because it’s a lot easier to estimate how much software they can deliver in the next two, — location: [1596](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1596) ^ref-61169

Agile developers build up great coding habits that help them create well-designed code. — location: [1614](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1614) ^ref-10811

The most effective way to communicate the progress of the project is to deliver working software and put it in the hands of the users (Principle #7). — location: [1635](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1635) ^ref-27715

Deleting code is not particularly destructive, because you can usually just recover it from the version control system. — location: [1663](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1663) ^ref-63801

---
The most effective way to do this is to work with your customers and stakeholders to only build the most useful and valuable software. — location: [1667](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1667) ^ref-53785

---
When a team is self-organizing, it means that they work together to plan the project (instead of relying on a single person who “owns” the plan), and they continually come together as a team to revise that plan. — location: [1687](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1687) ^ref-62989

---
The only way to become more capable as a team is to constantly look back at what you’ve done so far, to assess how well you’re working as a team, and to come up with a plan for getting better. — location: [1710](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1710) ^ref-8737

For Scrum to work, the team has to deeply and viscerally understand collective commitment and self-organization. — location: [1878](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=1878) ^ref-16692

So the Scrum Master doesn’t own the plan. He may help the team to create the plan.

When a team breaks a project into phases, it’s called incremental development. Scrum sprints are another way to break your project into increments, which is why Scrum is an incremental methodology. — location: [2542](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=2542) ^ref-37660

An iterative process is one that makes progress through successive refinement. A development team takes a first cut at a system, knowing it is incomplete or weak in some (perhaps many) areas.

When a team has a culture where the more experienced developer does the “grunt work” in a few minutes when it’s fresh rather than making a more junior team member spend hours on it later, that can be another source of the Scrum “hyper-productivity” and “astonishing results” that seem to elude many teams. — location: [2624](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=2624) ^ref-19210

The XP Values Communication Each team member is aware of the work everyone else is doing. Simplicity Developers focus on writing the most simple and direct solutions possible.

You can play a game of “Are you OK with?” about pair programing: Communication Are you OK with talking to your teammates while you’re programming? Are you OK with them talking to you? What about everyone talking about your code even if you’re not around? Simplicity Are you OK with someone pointing out that code you just wrote is too complex?

But a funny thing happens when programmers start doing test-driven development.

Does the idea of making code design decisions after the code is written seem odd? It doesn’t seem odd to an XP developer, because XP teams are constantly refactoring their code: — location: [4852](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=4852) ^ref-56914

When a system is designed so that its behavior seems to emerge from the interactions between the individual units working together, in a way that doesn’t seem to originate from one single unit, it’s called emergent design. — location: [5234](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=5234) ^ref-9622

Because it’s taking over six months for most users’ feature requests to make it into the software. Why is it taking over six months for users’ requests to make it into the software? Because those feature requests are almost always pushed back to make room on the schedule for last-minute changes. Why are there so many last-minute changes? Because before the team can release software to the users, they need to do a review with senior managers, and those senior managers almost always ask for basic, foundational changes. Why do the senior managers almost always ask for basic, foundational changes? Because they all have very specific opinions about how the software should look, how it needs to function, and sometimes even the technical tools that should be used to build it, but the team doesn’t hear those opinions until after they’ve built all of the code and have demoed it to the senior managers. Why doesn’t the team hear those opinions until after they’ve built all of the code and given a demo? Because the senior managers are too busy to talk to the team early in the project, so they’ll only attend the final demo — and send the team back to the drawing board after the software is finished. — location: [6040](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=6040) ^ref-28664

But because humans naturally intuit and follow rules, it’s also pretty likely that you can map out a small number of value streams that cover the majority of the MMFs that your team turns into code. — location: [6507](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=6507) ^ref-42261

There’s a good chance that they have a fractured perspective (just like we learned about in Chapter 2).

Teams can also write down their policies by adding “definitions of done” or “exit criteria” bullets to the bottom of each column on a kanban board, — location: [7059](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJ8YKRM&location=7059) ^ref-47476

This is why Kanban looks at the entire system in aggregate.
