Skip the 6-month LinkedIn learning curve

â†’ here's how

Since the beginning of 2024, 
I've been focused on building my personal brand on LinkedIn.

Initially, I started with unstructured posts, shooting in many different directions. 
I had no clue:
â†’ what to look at
â†’ what to focus on
â†’ how LinkedIn works.

Through daily posting and learning along the journey, 
I've grown in several exciting dimensions:
â€”â€”â€”
â†’ Simple Marketing for Smart People (by Billy Broas)
â†’ Advancing with my EN-language skills
â†’ Engagement tactics and networking
â†’ Copy writing in a skimmable format
â†’ Leveraging AI at various stages
â†’ Growing my Personal brand
â†’ Sales through LinkedIn 
â†’ Story-telling

If I could time travel back to the start of 2024, 
hereâ€™s what Iâ€™d recommend to my younger self:
â€”â€”â€”

â†’ Engage with the content of other LinkedIn contributors
â€”â€”
Engage, engage, engage ... I missed that for about the first 6 months in 2024.
Once I adjusted my approach, the numbers showed the difference.

â†’ Connect with others and leverage the connections you can make per week 
â€”â€”
Writing and engaging enables growth. 
If you want to actively drive growth, 
then actively connect with people.

â†’ Build your messages around a core argument
â€”â€”
My core argument:
â€”
Embrace smart learning approaches now:
to stay ahead,
to enhance your career resilience,
to unlock new opportunities for growth and innovation.

I'm learning a lot in this direction from 
Billy Broas and his Five Lightbulbs Marketing.

â†’ Write content in a skimmable format. 
â€”â€”
Differentiate for what a platform/approach is known for.

LinkedIn is a social media platform with fast scrolling behavior.

Long-form content is not what users expect.
Instead, I go with the flow and support speed.

Lots of learnings, right?

Are you thinking about starting on LinkedIn too? 
And would you like to jumpstart your journey?

I've externalized my learnings about LinkedIn. 

In my first newsletter, which I will publish tomorrow, 
I'll share the link to my LinkedIn Second Brain too.

The LinkedIn Second Brain is my collection of insights and supporting material that has helped me build my path on LinkedIn, collected over the past 4 months.

Sounds interesting?
