Join my Learning Styles Discovery Workshop on January 14th!  
â€”â€”â€” Oops, got excited there! Let me tell you the story first...  
  
I covered it all in my trainings.  
â†’ Shared my knowledge  
â†’ Included hands-on exercises  
â†’ Provided solid facts and evidence  
  
Yet, I lost some participants along the way.  
I could see it in their faces, in their diminishing participation.  
  
My easy explanation?  
  
"You can't engage everyone. Some just aren't interested."  
  
But something was missing. Something fundamental.  
Something I couldn't see because of my own learning style.  
  
As a WHAT/HOW-learner, I'm drawn to:  
â†’ Data and analytics  
â†’ Facts and evidence  
â†’ Practical exercises  
  
What I missed was the WHY:  
â†’ Explaining the bigger picture upfront  
â†’ Creating a vision of meaningful outcomes  
â†’ Building emotional connection from the start  
  
I failed to invite and include the WHY-Learner.  
  
Understanding different learning styles revealed my blind spots.  
  
Now I design trainings that speak to all 4 learning types.
