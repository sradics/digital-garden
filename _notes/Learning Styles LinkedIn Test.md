Unmasked: Inside My LinkedIn Laboratory  
  
â†’ Running My First Learning Styles Workshop  
  
Yesterday marked a milestone - our first Learning Styles workshop brought together attendees from different countries and backgrounds. All connections made through LinkedIn, most meeting for the first time in the workshop.  
  
Let me share the journey and learnings:  
  
The Marketing Experiment:  
â†’ 9! workshop teaser posts in 2 weeks  
â†’ Each post included a direct application link  
(yes, taking the LinkedIn penalty for audience convenience)  
  
Post engagement was good, but rarely led to direct applications.  
  
My Detective Work ... Following the Breadcrumbs of Interest:  
â†’ Likes  
â†’ Profile views  
â†’ Comments showing signals  
  
The Personal Touch:  
â†’ Sent 90 personalized DMs (no automation, no mass messaging)  
â†’Â 27 responses (30% response rate)  
âž  Result: 12 potential attendees, 7 workshop participants  
  
Here's What Puzzles Me:  
â€”â€”â€”  
Learning Styles fundamentally shapes how we grow and develop.  
  
A free workshop offering deeper insights seems like a no-brainer, right?  

Yet on LinkedIn, the message faces hurdles. Why?  
  
Possible Reasons:  
  
â†’ Topic relevance (I doubt that)  
â†’ My message is not clear (likely)  
â†’ Time constraints - even 2 minutes to apply feels too much (likely)  
â†’ My authenticity is not yet strong (likely)  
â†’ "Free = Low Value" perception (interesting barrier)  
  
What other factors might be at play?  
  
Want the full story?  
I'll detail this journey in my next newsletter on Friday.
