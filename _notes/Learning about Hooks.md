## 12 tips from Lara
1) Use specific numbers to gain trust  
2) Keep the hook between 7-10 words  
3) Reveal the final outcome in the hook  
4) Always deliver on the hooks promise  
5) Use the **first line to make a statement**  
6) And use the **second line to add context**  
7) Use curiosity to get them to "see more"  
8) Give them a benefit or immediate result  
9) Use transformations for emotional connection  
10) Keep it concise by focusing on one simple idea  
11) Use parenthesis to highlight a desired outcome  
12) Repeat using "you", "your", "How I" and "How you"
