3 Steps to Stay Motivated Amid Uncertainty  
(Scenarios — Vivid Vision — Backcast Goals)  
  
In a workshop with Graham Norris, I discovered the power of the Uncertainty Mindset. With an uncertainty mindset you:  
↳ build on creating awareness  
↳ activate imagination and  
↳ creativity.  
  
Embracing the unknown and being open to various future possibilities is key.  
  
3 steps to cultivate an Uncertainty Mindset:  
  
1️⃣ Think in Scenarios - Build Stories About Your Aspirational Future  
Develop multiple scenarios to prepare for different futures:  
→ What uncertainties exist?  
→ Elaborate on implications  
→ Name and describe each scenario  
→ How old are you and others in your scenario?  
→ Identify commonalities and differences across 4-5 scenarios  
  
2️⃣ Make Your Vision Vivid  
→ Create an aspirational future by embedding great experiences from your past  
→ Reflect on what is within your control or influence  
→ Make the future concrete  
  
3️⃣ Backcast Your Goals  
→ Work backwards from your long-term goal instead of starting from today  
→ Start with the future and trace back to the present  
  
By following these steps, we:  
💡Enhance problem-solving  
💡Prepare for different potential futures  
💡Increase resilience by being psychologically prepared for uncertainty  
💡Improve goal clarity and reduce constraints from immediate obstacles  
  
What’s your go-to strategy for staying motivated in uncertain times?

3 steps how to stay Motivated amid Uncertainty
(think Scenarios — vivid Vision — Backcast goals)

In a workshop with Graham Norris on the topic Staying Motivated Amid Uncertainty I learned about the Uncertainty mindset.

With an uncertainty mindset we build on creating awareness, activate imagination and creativity. I need to overcome my psychological allergy to uncertainty. And learn to embrace the unknown and being open to various future possibilities.

3 steps help to grow an uncertainty mindset:
1️⃣  Think in scenarios - build a story about your aspirational future
To broaden your perspective, develop multiple scenarios to prepare for different futures. 

You could start with:
+ how old are you and others in your scenario
+ what is the uncertainty (and what further uncertainty coexist)
+ name and describe the scenario
+ elaborate on implications
+ think about 4-5 scenarios and look at commonalities and main differences

2️⃣ Make your vision vivid
+ make it an ASPIRATIONAL future (e.g. by embedding great experiences from your past)
+ make the future concrete
+ reflect on what is in your control but at least your influence

3️⃣ Backcast on your goals
+ work backwards from your longer term goal (instead of starting from today)
+ instead of projecting from now to the future --- start with the future and trace back

Through these 3 steps we:
+ enhance Problem-Solving
+ prepare for different potential futures
+ improve goal clarity and are less constrained by immediate obstacles
+ increase resilience by being psychologically prepared for uncertainty

What's your go-to strategy for staying motivated in uncertain times?
