## Content preparation

### Distill my messages to a core
As usage of LinkedIn is often connected with limited attention span, I'm challenged to write distilled versions of my insights and experiences. This improves my writing with less fluff and getting to the core. 

### Extending my creativity 
Supporting posts with visuals, carousels request another level of my creativity. Through that challenge I got to explore MidJourney for image generation, experiment with Carousels and ways to express thoughts in sequences, think about proper visualizations and aspects of design. I'm still a newbie and at the same time looking at my learning curve on that topic, quite steep now.

### Reach Express stage of working with my Knowledge
I force myself to work with express stage of the C-O-D-E cycle of my Second Brain. Express means to use my Second Brain knowledge and create something new from it. Posts are a new version of my knowledge. It helps me to reflect, to recombine learnings, to link further and just creates another important touchpoint with my learnings. 

### Socialize and working out loud
Sharing from my experiences and working out loud in public enables new connections, might be of help for you to build on my insights and leverage learnings. I experience new and refreshed connections and have great conversations with smart people. 

### Drives overall Curiosity and Learning
I'm driven by Curiosity. LinkedIn writing is for me a great trigger and motivator for exploring. Having a daily writing goal channels my thoughts. It is super interesting how thinking about a potential next posts channels thoughts. I improved my thoughts capture routine, further streamline my core message and find it fascinating how my subconscious mind again and again presents me with next topics to write about. I read and process a lot of informations. LinkedIn writings provides another lense to processing.
