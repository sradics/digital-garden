My great-grandfather let me win at chess  
  
â†’ 42 years later, I finally understand why  
  
At age 5, my great-grandfather introduced me to chess, despite the game's recommended age of 8.  
  
Every weekend, he patiently taught me, initially letting me win to build confidence. Later, he introduced advanced moves like Scholar's Mate, gradually adjusting the difficulty as I improved.  
  
Over the years, our chess sessions evolved into moments of genuine competition and great conversation.  
  
This experience taught me valuable lessons beyond the game:  
  
â†’ When you teach, adapt to the learner's level  
(I'm still working on mastering this one)  
  
â†’ It creates high-quality time. (Board) games build meaningful connections and shared experiences.  
(Even more with the raise of cooperative games like Andor.)  
  
â†’ You develop essential traits:  
â‡¢ Patience  
â‡¢ Resilience in defeat  
â‡¢ Growth through iteration  
  
âž  Learning through play is powerful  
(Tip: Check out "Gamestorming" by Gray Dave and Sunni Brown)  
  
Sidenote:  
I still wrestle with the strategy of orchestrating early wins.  
  
(I followed a different route with my children and see the results in the Great KINGDOMINO Downfall: [https://lnkd.in/eDDR9rJS](https://lnkd.in/eDDR9rJS))  
  
What's your take - and what will you (re)play next?
