You say - I have no time to learn

â†’ I say Yes - I gave up too
â†’ All is fast, and I am so busy
â†’ Days packed with work, and life
â†’ Learning is just something I do later

Actually, I would never say that!

I got early on inspired by:
"Compassion is given for free; envy must be earned"

It motivates me to ask for opposite opinions.

Here is my one.
Every. Single. Day.
I put in the effort to Learn.

I focus on leveraging Kindle highlights

I focus on asking AI questions
I stopped doing random searches

I focus on structured learning
I stopped doing unstructured learning

I focus on Switch Writing and invite AI writing
I stopped writing everything from scratch

I focus on organizing my knowledge
I stopped having my information scattered 

The catch?

Most of what I needed to do was:

â†’ Use structures that support learning
â†’ Integrate AI tools for learning
â†’ Invite Learning to my day
