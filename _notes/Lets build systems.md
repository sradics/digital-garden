# [[Lets build systems]]

## LinkedIn Post

[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_26-projects-thats-my-current-reality-activity-7289900233872793600-iKIQ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

26 projects. That's my current reality.  
  
Want to know the scary part? I'm handling them all with ease.  
  
Systems permit ordinary people,  
To achieve extraordinary results predictably.  
â€”â€”â€” Michael E.Gerber â€”â€”â€”  
  
Quick reality check: Count your active projects on your fingers.  
Ran out of fingers, didn't you?  
  
I just counted mine: 16 business projects, 10 personal ones.  
Each needing attention. Each waiting for my next move.  
  
Here's what most people face:  
â†’ Monday: Strategic planning for project A  
â†’ Tuesday: Deep dive into project B  
â†’ Wednesday: Urgent request from project C  
â†’ Thursday: Back to project A, but... where were we?  
  
Sound familiar?  
  
We all know that moment:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Rebuilding context we've lost  
â†’ Scanning through scattered notes  
â†’ Trying to remember our last breakthrough  
â†’ Sometimes even redoing work we've already done  

The worst part?  
â€”â€”â€”  
We often procrastinate on important projects,  
knowing how painful it'll be to get back into them.  
  
But there's another way:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Open your project folder  
â†’ Find everything exactly where you need it  
â†’ Pick up precisely where you left off  
â†’ Build on your previous work, instantly  
  
Sounds like a dream? It's actually a system -  
one that transforms overwhelm into opportunity.  
  
This Wednesday (Jan 29th), join my Second Brain Discovery workshop to turn your project chaos into clear progress.
