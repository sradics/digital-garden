üöÄ How I Fast-Track LinkedIn and gained Key Insights in 3 Days üöÄ  
(Insights I hadn‚Äôt discovered even after 6 months of daily writing)  
  
Looking back, I wish I had joined this community earlier üò≥  
  
It‚Äôs been 3 days with Brand Built, and I‚Äôve already:  
‚úì run through the 12-week LinkedIn mastery course  
‚úì attended my first community sessions  
‚úì experienced an engaging community  

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  
My top 5 insights so far:  
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  
1Ô∏è‚É£ Engagement‚ÄºÔ∏è:  
It‚Äôs not only about creating content.  
I completely underestimated the importance of engagement.  
To grow an audience, you need to connect and engage with valuable insights from peers.  
  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Ideal Client Profile:  
I need to go deeper into defining my Ideal Client Profile.  
  
Who exactly wants to:  

> learn faster,  
> keep more, and  
> is willing to invest time and money for that?  

3Ô∏è‚É£ Profile Optimization:  
Next steps on my profile - banner, tagline, featured section, and about me.  
  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Content Structure:  
The Hook-Story-Solution-Result-CTA format and  
many insights into content structure and formatting.  
  
5Ô∏è‚É£ Engagement Strategy:  
An enriched process for my engagement strategy.  
This already helps me to follow through, track my daily behavior and progress.  
  
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  
These insights have already led to:  
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  
‚Üí My experiment frame for the next 30 days on LinkedIn  
‚Üí Setting up my process for better engagement and working on it daily  
‚Üí First changes to my post structure and partially reworked featured section  
‚Üí A tailored and condensed version with key insights from the LinkedIn mastery course  

Being part of the Brand Built community amplifies my progress.  
  
Working in this community helps me to:  
  
‚Üí Reflect on my approaches  
‚Üí Increase my commitment and accountability  
‚Üí Gain insights from peers and founders+experts [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAFjpa8B7wpeBT3HiBnn6GitlAjVuum3dLc)[Nat Berman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanielberman/) and [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAFvS4MBjL7DwPIaIty21SMNubtWoscPOOQ)[Darren Mass](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrenmass/)  

In the next days, I‚Äôll re-watch and learn from the recorded community sessions and expert talks.  
  
Paralleled with further extensive note-taking and feeding my Second Brain üß†.  
  
What is your experience with communities?

## Content preparation

How I FastTrack LinkedIn and gain main insights after 3 days
(Insights I did not discover yet even after 6 months of daily writing)

Looking back, I wished I could have joined that community earlier. 

It is 3 days with Brand Built. I ran through the 12 weeks LinkedIn mastery course, attended first community sessions and experienced a highly engaged community. 

My main 5 insights from just 3 days:
+ I completely underestimated the importance of engagement. It is not only about creating own content. To grow an audience one needs to also actively connect and engage with the valuable insights provided from peers. 
+ I need to go deeper into defining my Ideal Client Profile. Who exactly wants to learn faster and retain more and at the same time is willing to invest time and money for that?
+ Next steps on my profile - banner, tagline, featured, about me
+ The Hook-Story-Solution-Result-CTA format and many insights in content structure and formatting
+ An enriched process for my engagement strategy, helping me to follow through and track my daily behavior and progress

These insights already led to:
+ A defined experiment frame for my next 30 days in LinkedIn
+ Setting up my process for better engagement and working on it daily now
+ First changes on my post structure, partially reworked featured section
+ My fast lane to the 12 weeks LinkedIn masteryI realise how much being part of the Brand Built community amplifies my progress. Working in this community helps me to:
+ Reflect on my approaches
+ have a higher level of accountability and commitment
+ Gain valuable expert insights from peers, and especially from the community founders and experts Nat Berman and Darren Mass

In the next days I'll re-watch and learn from the recorded community sessions and expert talks. Paralleled with further extensive note talking and feeding my Second Brain üß†
