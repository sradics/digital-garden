Cyber Week Confession: I Bought It All.
Now What? (Hint: It's Not Returns)

â†’ I purchased this big, wide-screen curved monitor.
â†’ I bought this amazing course that helps me write better newsletters.

Did you go all in on Black Friday or Cyber Week too?

Now you're sitting on a treasure (at least in theory!).
But are you harnessing the power from these purchases yet?

There's one formula that, since I first encountered it, hasn't left my mind.
â‡¢ This formula pushes me to explore.
â‡¢ To truly start using the tools and approaches.

Instead of missing out on power as I did in the past:
â†’ Hoarding tools and approaches without ever maximizing their potential
â†’ Being distracted by the fancy new toy syndrome
â†’ Hopping to the next island, promised to be greener.
â†’ Not really taking action

I turn my purchases into power when I take action:
â†’ Play with the configurations of the wide screen. 
â†’ Experiment with setups for better writing and referencing materials
E.g. optimize my online sessions with a comprehensive overview, following chats, and having follow-ups at hand immediately

Only then do I leverage the investment.

It is the moment I apply. 
The moment I take action. 

The moment I engage both factors of the POWER formula:

KNOWLEDGE x ACTION = POWER

No action â†’ Zero Power
No knowledge â†’ Zero Power

It is all about adding action to the knowledge enhancing tools and approaches. 

We live in an abundance of such tools and approaches. 

Let's add action to convert them into power.

I help people learn how to learn, retain, and recall with ease

I help you take ACTION! And with that, achieve your POWER.
