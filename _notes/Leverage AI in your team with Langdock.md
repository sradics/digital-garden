# Leverage AI in your team with Langdock
Recently I got to know [Langdock https://www.langdock.com/](https://www.langdock.com/) - the "GDPR ChatGPT for your team" that so much more. The following list of features impressed me right away:

+ I can **connect** Langdock with **my Knowledge Management System**s like Notion, Confluence, Slack,... and more
+ I can easily **build prompt Libraries** and share **that** with my team members
+ And Langdock already comes with a growing library of **pre-defined prompts**
+ I can invite team members to my already defined prompts and we can **work on the prompts together**
+ I can **chose between different LLMs** like ChatGPT and Claude and many more
+ It has **build in Workflows** e.g. for generating awesome mails in currently some pre-defined tone. This will be extended soon
+ I ‚ù§Ô∏è the suggestions for follow up prompts

## What becomes possible - some use cases
+ We can connect to our knowledge bases and work with existing knowledge (see example below where I work with our Coaching Methodology description)
+ We can co-create in a team
+ It avoids scattered prompts and tough to integrate created insights using e.g. ChatGPT in individual space. As a team we can now share fast and take steps together. Via prompt sharing we also learn fast together, what prompts work.

## Some examples from working with Langdock
