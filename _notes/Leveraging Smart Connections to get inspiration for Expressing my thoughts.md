 ✨ Imagine if your notes could generate ideas for you. Now, they can. 💡  
(How I leverage my Second Brain with Smart Connections-AI to get inspired for my posts)  
  
Ever struggled to express your thoughts or find inspiration for your post? I was in the same boat until I discovered the power of combining AI with my Second Brain in Obsidian. 🧠💡  
  
✪ I've been working with the Obsidian plugin Smart Connections by [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAfCZmsB14SC0ZN3SJeGgS3uDk2d5n9Dyiw)[Brian Petro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wfhbrian/). This tool allows me to collaborate with various AI LLMs directly on my local notes in [Obsidian](https://www.linkedin.com/company/obsidianmd/). The result? A treasure trove of insights and ideas and a new level of serendipity. 🙌  
  
✪ To kick things off, I used my list of 12 running problems as the context for Smart Connections. (Curious about what they are? I've linked them in the comments! 🔗)  
  
📝 Prompt in Smart Connections: What are my main topics I would like to focus on based on my notes [My running list of 12 favorite problems]  
  
✪ Next, I asked for content inspiration based on my main topics of interest. What I got in return was a list of 50 fascinating topics for future posts. Talk about a gold mine of inspiration! 🌟  
  
📝Prompt: Based on the overview of topics I'm dedicating my time for I'm sharing next with you, please based on all my notes, what would you suggest as short form articles I could create. I would like you to derive 50 article headlines and a rough article skeloton.  
  
Here is a an overview on my topics:  
...list of topics...  
  
✪ Let's take a closer look at one of these topics: "Automate Your Life: Freeing Time for What Matters Most". I asked for specific ideas based on my notes, and the AI delivered. The result was my previous post, fueled by insights discovered through Smart Connections - [https://lnkd.in/eYQ7VP6a](https://lnkd.in/eYQ7VP6a). 🚀  
  
I've become a supporter of Smart Connections! This means I can now work directly with a GPT on my notes. I can't wait to share more about my experiences with this fantastic extension. Stay tuned! 🎉

## Content preparation
+ The problem: I grow my Second Brain using Obsidian and I want to leverage AI to work with my notes to express my thoughts and getting inspired on content to write about. 
+ In Obsidian I use the plugin Smart Connections by Brian Petro. Via SmartConnections I can work with several AI LLMs on my local notes.
+ I used my 12 running problems I'm focussing on to define the context for Smart Connections (if curios you can find my 12 running problems linked in the comments)
Prompt: What are my main topics I would like to focus on based on my notes [My running list of 12 favorite problems]
+ Next I asked for inspiration what I might write about next via the prompt

Based on the overview of topics I'm dedicating my time for I'm sharing next with you, please based on all my notes, what would you suggest as short form articles I could create. I would like you to derive 50 article headlines and a rough article skeloton.

Here is a an overview on my topics: 
...list of topics...

+ and got a list of 50 super interesting topics for next posts, with good headlines. 

Now to zoom in on a topic I drilled down via:
Based on my notes - What could I write about "Automate Your Life: Freeing Time for What Matters Most". Please also provide a note reference like title or link for each note you suggest something from.

And this provided me great input for my previous post. Based on that input and fine-tuning my thoughts I got inspired for the post and was able to leverage my Second Brain with discoveries that were made through creating Smart Connections. 

BTW. I today also became a support for Smart Connections and will be able to work with a GPT directly on my notes. I'll provide updates soon on my experiences with this great extension.
