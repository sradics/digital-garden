## LinkedIn Post

[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_the-linkedin-game-i-refuse-to-play-anymore-activity-7291711978404761600-zWBK?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

The LinkedIn game I refuse to play anymore

â†’ 3,000+ connections and countless hours later,

I learned this hard truth:  
Real connections matter more than any metric.

â€”â€”â€” MY SHIFT â€”â€”â€”  
I'm leaving behind:  
â†’ The chase for vanity metrics  
â†’ Mechanical engagement pods  
â†’ The "comment everywhere" game  

Instead, I'm choosing what lights me up:  
â†’ Content that truly serves my learning community  
â†’ Genuine conversations that spark ideas  
â†’ Relationships that grow naturally  

â€”â€”â€” FROM THE HEART â€”â€”â€”  
I want to connect deeply with:  
â†’ Fellow explorers in learning innovation  
â†’ Curious minds diving into Second Brain and PKM  
â†’ People who bring their authentic thoughts to the table  

What this means for you:  
â†’ Share a thoughtful comment? 
âž  You'll get my full attention  

â†’ Want to chat privately? 
âž  My DM is open for real connection and exploring possibilities together  

â†’ AI-generated comments? 
Thanks, but I'm looking for real human connection  

Yes, this might mean fewer likes, less reach, slower growth.  
I guess I need to live with that.  

What matters is building a community of real learners and innovators.  

That's the journey I'm choosing.  

Ready to explore together? 

I'm all yours.
