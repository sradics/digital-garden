Fragile habits, strong connections:  
  
â†’ The unexpected rewards of daily content creation  
  
Yesterday [Mayank Maurya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/magicalwritermayank/) provided a comment that made me reflect.  
  
The comment was:  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
You are one of the finest creators Iâ€™ve ever seen!  
âž¡ Seriously, your opinions are NEXT LEVEL.  
  
Think about itâ€”  
âž¡ There's no other creator whoâ€™s this genuine.  
  
So detailed, so on point.  
âž¡ You show up every single day.  
  
You help us learnâ€”  
âž¡ From your daily experiences.  
  
Thanks for bringing these insights,  
âž¡ We seriously appreciate you for this.  
  
You da best!  
âž¡ Keep shining, weâ€™re here for it!  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
"You show up every single day. "  
â€”  
Indeed, I've shown up every day since the start of 2024.  
  
I'm convinced that:  
â†’ Habits are fragile;  
Showing up each day is a simple rule to keep and manifest a habit.  
  
â†’ Consistency, paired with continuous improvement matters  
â†’ It builds a strong connection with awesome contributors showing up daily too  

"There's no other creator whoâ€™s this genuine"  
â€”  
â†’ I guess my topic: "To help people to learn how to learn" is indeed special  
â†’ Simultaneously, when we use our own voice and experience,  
  
We become genuine creators.  
  
Here's what I can say about my daily posts:  
â†’ I'm the one writing them.  
â†’ They express my experiences.  
â†’ They're nerdy, I know.  

"One of the finest creators" ... had to GPT that  
â€”  
"... implies a rare and remarkable level of talent, possibly in artistic, intellectual, or innovative fields."  
  
â†’ I think I can relate to that  
â†’ I re-discovered my JOY IN LEARNING  
â†’ I found a top-notch approach to connect learning approaches  
â†’ I innovate on that field of learning  

"You help us learn"  
â€”  
â†’ Literally I do  
â†’ Through my approach and my daily thoughts.  
  
At the same time,  
I'm grateful for the many lessons I gain each day from all of you.  

"Keep shining, weâ€™re here for it!"  
â€”  
I will, my friends and dear readers.  

Wish you all an awesome Sunday.  

â€”â€”â€”  
P.S.  
I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease
