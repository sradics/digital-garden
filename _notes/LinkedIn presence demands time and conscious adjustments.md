My fitness was under immense pressure  
  
→ I thought I had it under control  
→ Then a bigger change appeared  
→ My fitness routine sidelined shortly  
→ It was time to adjust my day planning  
  
🚴‍♂️ For 2024 I passed 18500 minutes exercising.  
On average 90 minutes EVERY day fitness.  
Benchmarked to 3000 minutes a month.  
  
Monitoring my fitness routine showed a change!  
I recently was not longer able to keep the 3k/month.  
  
———  
What happened?  
———  
  
↳ My approach to writing and engaging changed  
↳ Usually I wrote & posted daily in the morning  
↳ But did not engage with others that much  
  
➠ In hindsight, this was a big mistake!  
  
↳ I had to adjust and engage NOW  
↳ What led to much higher load  
  
———  
Recognise & Adjust  
———  
Time is a limited resource. The constraint.  
I streamlined the scattered parts.  
  
Decisions made:  
  
→ Writing and engaging in a block  
→ Fitness routine - adjusted to 75'/day  
→ Two deep focus 2h work sessions per day  
→ Integrated breaks and two Power-Naps  
→ Second LinkedIn engagement block  
→ Planned community engagement  
→ Planned extra learning time  
  
Leading to:  
  
➠ a new balanced fitness routine  
➠ higher focus on daily life components  
➠ a discipline frame that holds me accountable  
  
———  
Conclusions & Recommendations  
———  
→ Define your fitness goals in context  
→ Watch your fitness routine  
→ Adjust fast to changes  
→ Build a new routine  
  
What works well for you when it comes to fitness?
