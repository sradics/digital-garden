## The hook is 90% of a good post.  
‚Ü≥ It's a promise to your reader.  
‚Ü≥ It gets them in the room.  
‚Ü≥ It gives them the post.  
  
## The re-hook retains reader attention.  
‚Ü≥ It immediately connects to first line.  
‚Ü≥ It slams the door behind.  
‚Ü≥ It adds 'heft' to first line.  
  
## Formatting is underrated.  
‚Ü≥ It should symbolise a progressive journey.  
‚Ü≥ It needs to be visually appealing.  
‚Ü≥ It guides the reader's eye.  
  
## Write directly to one reader.  
‚Ü≥ Use the ‚ÄúDear Son‚Äù framework to  
‚Ü≥ Make your content feel personal.  
‚Ü≥ Make your content intimate.  
  
## Use 3-7 ‚Äòpinned‚Äô comments per post.  
‚Ü≥ Each drives engagement and ‚Äòdwell time‚Äô  
‚Ü≥ Wait 10 minutes before adding these.  
‚Ü≥ Questions, bonuses, photos, CTAs  
  
## Give everything away to your audience.  
‚Ü≥ Share 100% of what you know.  
‚Ü≥ Templates, tactics, tools, tips.  
‚Ü≥ Give, give, give, take.  
  
## Add a ‚ÄòP.S‚Äô at the end of every post.  
‚Ü≥ It should make it easy to respond.  
‚Ü≥ It should promote engagement.  
‚Ü≥ Breaks the ‚Äòflow‚Äô of the post.
