# LinkedIn writing tips

## The hook is 90% of a good post.  
↳ It's a promise to your reader.  
↳ It gets them in the room.  
↳ It gives them the post.  
  
## The re-hook retains reader attention.  
↳ It immediately connects to first line.  
↳ It slams the door behind.  
↳ It adds 'heft' to first line.  
  
## Formatting is underrated.  
↳ It should symbolise a progressive journey.  
↳ It needs to be visually appealing.  
↳ It guides the reader's eye.  
  
## Write directly to one reader.  
↳ Use the “Dear Son” framework to  
↳ Make your content feel personal.  
↳ Make your content intimate.  
  
## Use 3-7 ‘pinned’ comments per post.  
↳ Each drives engagement and ‘dwell time’  
↳ Wait 10 minutes before adding these.  
↳ Questions, bonuses, photos, CTAs  
  
## Give everything away to your audience.  
↳ Share 100% of what you know.  
↳ Templates, tactics, tools, tips.  
↳ Give, give, give, take.  
  
## Add a ‘P.S’ at the end of every post.  
↳ It should make it easy to respond.  
↳ It should promote engagement.  
↳ Breaks the ‘flow’ of the post.
