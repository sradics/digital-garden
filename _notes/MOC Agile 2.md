# MOC Agile 2
[[Sparks from Agile 2]] - captured initial thoughts what to further look at, what was inspiring while reading

## Emphasize on Leadership
+ [[Agile 2 and Leadership]] - condensed aspects of leadership described throughout the book
	+ [[Socratic Leadership]] - this was new to me, really interesting approach to empower groups and also to foster learning. 
	+ [[Leadership roles in product development]]
	+ [[Gemba - Go where the work gets done]]
	+ [Leadership Taxonomy](https://agile2.net/more-resources/a-leadership-taxonomy/)
	+ [Leadership sketch](https://agile2.net/more-resources/a-leadership-sketch/)

# Linking
+ [[MOC Agile Learning Path]] - overall agile learning areas
+ [[Kurt Cagle-Agile 2]] - my 2nd stage processing file - all highlights extracted from Kindle
