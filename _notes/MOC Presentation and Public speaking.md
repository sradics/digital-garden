## Notes from Breathing for Health
[Source](https://www.blinkist.com/en/app/shortcasts/the-doctor-s-kitchen/455?collection=beat-presentation-anxiety-in-9-days)

+ breathing has a Body-Mind-Connection
+ Our breathing reflects the way that we feel
	+ if we have no reason whatsoever to feel stressed or anxious, but we're breathing in a stressed or anxious way, it's going to cause us to feel stressed or anxious
+ breathwork is any time you become aware of your breathing and then use it purposefully
+ we were able to **increase vagal tone over a 20 minute breathing session**. Not just a little bit, not even just doubling it, which by itself would be crazy. We increased it **by nearly 600%.** 
+ Our physical and mental actions and behaviors are completely interconnected and building a breathwork habit can help with both
+ **An emotion is simply a chemical reaction that happens and creates certain sensations**. And then we group those sensations together and we define that as a feeling or an emotion

## Notes from How to improvise
[Source](https://www.blinkist.com/en/app/shortcasts/cautionary-tales/446?collection=beat-presentation-anxiety-in-9-days)
- History, music and neuroscience all suggest you may **produce some of your best work by learning to let go**
- He would research, draft, redraft, memorise, finally deliver with passion.
- **Improvisers shut down their inner critics** and allow new ideas to flow out, escaping their internal restraints.
- They're letting go. **The improvising brain is disinhibited,**
	- That is why improvisers can produce flashes of pure brilliance.
- **Too much filtering can squash our creativity**
- **improvisation** as the **freedom and space to hear things.**
	- Let go of your inhibitions and give yourself what Miles Davis called the freedom and space to hear things.
- So the lesson here is **not to abandon all preparation**, but at a certain point, all of your meticulous preparations may become a constraint.
- You may **be surprised what you can achieve when you quiet your inner critic and stop holding back.**
