## The Rule of One
+ People enjoy **==simple content==**, like to **==feel special and are busy==**!

+ Write for **==one person==**
+ About **==one problem==**
+ Sharing **==one solution==**
+ Using **==one story==**
+ With **==one call to action==**

## Use YOU as the most beautiful word in the English Language
When we read we have only one question in mind: **==What is in it for me?==**

Do not:
+ just tell stories about yourself
+ talk about their readers problems. People don't enjoy feeling bad!

The reader is the hero! Bounce between You and I.

![[Pasted image 20240329173422.png]]

+ Whenever it‚Äôs the **reader's fault, remove the blame** or put it on an enemy. **Talk about ‚Äòwe‚Äô, ‚Äòthey‚Äô, or ‚ÄòI‚Äô.** 
+ Whenever it‚Äôs in the **reader's benefit, empower them. Use ‚Äòyou‚Äô**

## Make your Writing a Slippery Slide
Slippery Side Writing
+ Short first sentences
+ Small paragraphs
+ Questions
+ Stories
+ Bullets
+ Visuals
+ Sub-Headlines
+ Varied sentence length
+ Seeds of curiosity and open loops (announce something in the beginning and come back to that later)

connects well with [[On Writing]]


## Be the Guide, not the Guru
**==Swap How To's for How I's==**

## The 33% Rule
Write **==concise, curious, clear==**

Set a target to **==reduce word count by 33% before you publish==**!

+ Read it out loud. Where it does not flow, change!
+ Change the screen and check it on your phone
+ First draft fast, second slow, final edit and then go

## Build bridges for readers
Use **==simple language, useful explanations and logical sequence==**.

## Don't write words, paint pictures

+ Stories - chose the simples ones, that your reader can relate to most
+ Analogies - illustrate your ideas
![[Pasted image 20240329174657.png]]


+ Metaphors - is a direct comparison
![[Pasted image 20240329174738.png]]

+ Personification - give human-like attributes

![[Pasted image 20240329174823.png]]

+ Anecdotes
+ Specific details
![[Pasted image 20240329174916.png]]

## Five For, Five Against
+ What do you believe strongly about that most people don‚Äôt?
+ What pisses you off?

## 4 W's of Winning Ideas
A winning idea lights your reader on fire, getting them to declare: 
+ ‚ÄúYes, this is precisely how I feel!‚Äù 
+ ‚ÄúFinally, someone said it!‚Äù 
+ ‚ÄúWow, this is useful!‚Äù 
+ **==I feel like this person gets me.==**

+ **==Why should my reader care?==** 
	+ What makes this different?

	+ What moment did I first find this?
	+ What other times have I noticed? 
+ **==What can I build to help my reader win?==**
	+ What is my unique mechanism? 
+ **==Who else can support this argument?==**
