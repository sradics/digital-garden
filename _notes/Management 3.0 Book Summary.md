* Management is primarily about people and their relationships, not about departments and their profits
* management 3.0 = complexity
* need to replace hierarchies with networks
* agile software development is the best way to develop software
    *  old style management is the biggest obstacle
* managers must learn how social systems work


## complexity is one of the most important concepts in the 21th century



* those who know all about one level of a hierarchical system may be unqualified to deal with higher or lower levels because those other levels require different knowledge
* applying linear thinking to complex system can create big mistakes


# Innovation {#innovation}



* innovation is key to survive for many organisations - crucial elements for innovation are
    * knowledge - to be productive
    * creativity - to produce original and useful results
    * motivation - to do something worth doing it
    * diversity - adds robustness and flexibility to an organisation
    * personality - result of people embracing a number of basic virtues
* the orga must focus on actionable items out of ideas to really get innovation implemented
* a team consumes information and produces innovation (means - it also need the information)


# agile fundaments {#agile-fundaments}



* people
    * are unique individuals
    * required to self organize
    * are trusted
* functionality
    * direct customer involvement
    * simplicity as key for the design of each feature
* quality
    * focus on it is crucial
    * technological excellence is needed
    * tdd, code reviews, definition of done, iterative development, refactoring, emergent design (do it when needed)
* tools
    * for daily builds, ci, automated testing
    * to avoid boring tasks and concentrate on innovative tasks
* time
    * sprints - to produce valuable results in a short time frame
* value
    * fast respond to change (through fast feedback cycles)
    * detect the need in moment
* process 
    * daily face to face communication
    * continuous improvement 
* conflict
    * conflicts as natural aspect of complex systems
    * force improvement


## complexity {#complexity}



* difference between complexity and complication
    * e.g. a clock is complicated but not hard to to understand
    * a group of 3 people is not complicated but complex in it's behaviour


### body of knowledge of systems {#body-of-knowledge-of-systems}



* system theory
    * a team can construct itself, can define its identity, needs to interact with its environment and importance of interaction between team members
    * most phenomena can be viewed as webs of relationships among elements
* cybernetics
    * study of systems that have goal and interact with their environment through feedback mechanisms
    * understand the process in regulatory systems - that include iterations of acting (with effect on the environment), sensing (check response of environment), evaluating (compare current state with the goal)
    * a team is a goal oriented system that regulated itself using various feedback cycles
* dynamical system theory
    * systems have states - some are stable others not
    * not longer changing states or states where systems tends too are attractors
    * helps to explain why some projects are stable and why sometimes an organization reverts back to its original behaviour
* game theory
    * multiple systems compete for the same resources and systems may develop competing strategies
    * helps to explain the bevaviour of people in teams and of teams in organizations
* evolutionary theory
    * teams, product and projects evolve while adapting to their changing environment
    * helps to understand growth, survival and adoptions of systems over time
* chaos theory
    * even smallest changes can have tremendous consequences at a later time
    * behaviour of complex systems is often unpredictable
    * consequences for estimation, planning and control
* dimension of a complex system
    * simple or complicated
    * ordered, complex, chaotic


# energize people {#energize-people}



* creative phase
    * preconventional creativity
        * children &lt;7 years
        * creative without knowing constraints
    * conventional creativity
        * children &lt;11 years
        * creative with knowing constraints and domination of constraints
    * postconventional creativity
        * >11 years
        * knowing constraints but produce new things that use the constrains
* problem with knowledge - it constrains peoples few of the world
* you need to push people to the postconvetional creativity (orga often stuck in conventional creativity)
* give challenges - e.g expose them to environments that stimulate reflection and inspiration
* environment should be creative too - its the managers task to do this
    * safety
        * freedom to take risks and ask questions
        * acknowledgment that failures are OK
        * with safety you're more inclined to express ideas
    * play
        * play games (turn activities into little games, play games during lunch break)
    * variation
        * routine work kill creativity
    * make sure there is always sufficient variation
    * visibility
        * show creativity results
    * edge
        * try to get edge experiences (bungee jumping,...)
        * make real challenges a little scary
* creativity is based on intrinsic motivation
    * care about orga survival
    * care about innovation
    * care about creativity
    * care about intrinsic motivation
* motivators
    * challenging work
    * achievement
    * personal growth
    * recognition
    * responsibilities,...
* hygiene factors (if not present they cause damage)
    * job security
    * salary
    * status
    * working conditions
    * policies
    * fringe benefits,...
* intrinsic needs 
    * competence - the person must be capable in coping with the environment
    * autonomy - autonomous choice of action
    * relatedness - care for and be related to others, be involved in social world


### 10 desires of team members {#10-desires-of-team-members}



* make people feel competent - challenging but within their grasp
* feel accepted - make compliments on achievements
* curiosity (Neugier) must be addressed
* satisfying their honor
* idealism - contribution to make the world a better place
* independence - different from other people with own tasks and responsibilities
* order - some company rules and policies
* power - listen to what they have to say and arrange possibilities to do so
* social contacts - create environment to emerge ~ 
* status - let them see their status in the organization


#### ASK what can I do to help you do your best work? {#ask-what-can-i-do-to-help-you-do-your-best-work}



* acknowledges that person is capable of doing her best
* person evaluates her own performance
* initiates discussion about further improvements

Create motivational balance sheets



* list points that could influence motivation and say if it motivates or demotivated - make the final balance of all points


## creative techniques {#creative-techniques}



* processes
    * creative problem solving, productive thinking model, synetics
* problem definition
    * who, why, what, where, when, how
    * divide into chunks
* idea generation
    * brainstorming, talking pictures
* idea selection
    * anonymous voting, consensus mapping, sticking dots

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">incentives</span>



* the pushing of individuals in a complex system leads to side effects that cannot be forseen

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">diversity</span>



* watch for every team member what connections it creates in the organizations network - to extends the common network
    * search for new people that extends or strengthen that network
    * use it in the recruiting talks - scan for behaviour to build networks

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">personality</span>



* do personal assessments for each team member ask, present your own results and let them share if they want
    * test - Big five factors of personality or sixteen personality factor questionnaire
* do it yourself team values kit - to create own set of team values  s.92
    * define also your personal values - and use not a different value set to your team (except you have all the team values already)
* remove open door policy (implies, that there are bigger differences) - better have a no door policy

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">self organization</span>



* self organization is the default (in nature)
    * makes no distinction between good or bad -- command and control pattern was invented
* emergence - a property in a system that cannot be traced back to its individual parts is an emergent property
    * supervenience - property does not longer exist, if you remove the individual parts
    * not an aggregate - e.g. fluidity of water is not only through the addition of water molecules
    * downward causality - influences the individual parts - e.g. culture influences its group members
    * physics - chemistry -  biology - psychology - economics
        * each level has emergent properties
        * you can't explain problems by only picking one part of a system
    * collective decision making without central planning
    * system (team) can be more than the sum of its parts
    * emergent behaviour of a team cannot be predicted when you put a team together
* self selection - team that selects it's own team members - its an emerging team (no manager was not defined by the manager)
* self direction - no management from outside is directing (some friends playing football)
* darkness principle - each team member has only an incomplete mental model of the whole projects
    * thats why you need to plan and decide together
    * self organized teams increase control (because the darkness principle is also applied to managers)
    * software development = micromanagement by the team
    * delegation of control is the best way to keep projects manageable - Conant-Ashby Theorem - Every good regulator of a system must have a model of that system
        * you push decisions and responsibilities down to a level where someone has information that is smaller in size and more accurate
        * most of the decisions should be made in the subsystems
* distributed control is better (nature did it - brain, digestive nerv system, immune system)
    * a single controlling authority makes a system neither robust nor resilient
* empowerment
    * core responsibility of a manager
    * reason - improve manageability and also motivation
    * people must be empowered to make their own decisions based on their (better) information - whether they like it or not
    * don't create motivational dept
        * don't be bossy - people don't want to be told what to do - they want to be asked
    * wear a wizard's hat
        * the wise wizards never do the real work - they help the heros to succeed
    * is more than just delegation 
        * includes support of risk taking, personal growth and cultural change
        * also acknowledges how powerful people already are
    * improves worker satisfaction and quality of life
    * improves productivity and quality of service
    * does not diminish your own status - itâ€™s more likely to increase it
        * you make your team (and therewith yourself) better if you empower it
    * investment (takes a while to pay the interest rate) in social capital
    * choose the right maturity level - low, moderate, high
    * pick right authority level - Tell, Sell, Consult, Agree, Advise, Inquire, Delegate
        * tell - make decision and announce it
        * sell - make decision and attempt to gain commitment
        * consult - invite and weight input before making a decision
        * agree - invite workers and join a discussion to reach consensus in a group - your voice is equal to others
        * advise - attempt to influence workers by telling them our opinion - they decide
        * inquire - let them decide first - ask them to convince you afterwards
        * delegate - leave decision entirely up to the team
    * gradually build up empowerment - by giving more and more challenging tasks
    * number of persons to involve for each task?
        * depends on risk - a group can reduce the risk
        * options (depends on the situation):
            * one specific person with another (higher) level
            * express the requirement that must agree
            * allow people on the same level to act on their own
            * team needs to assign someone to do something
    * use delegation checklist (page 132) - all questions should be answered with yes - if not - make the team aware of it
        * is the risk factor of delegating this work adequately addressed
        * do the people have the right empowerment skills and discipline
        * have you considered and selected the right level of authority
        * have you considered the question of delegating to individuals or to teams
        * is what you're delegating a discrete chunk of work
        * do the people have the skills to do this particular kind of work
        * do the people have the right format for the work products to use
        * do the people have the tools necessary to be useful
        * do the people know what the results should look like
        * did you set the boundary conditions for the work (e.g. budget, time, resources)
        * do the people know when the work is due
        * do the people know what progress looks like
        * do the people know how often to report to you on progress
        * is someone available to coach or mentor the people in case they need help
    * if you want something done - practice your patience (never do it yourself)
        * what did I do wrong - use the checklist to analyze this too
        * address the intrinsic desires
        * make sure that the environment is supportive (and work on it if its not the case)
* trust
    * trust your team
        * let them solve problems in the team
        * make it clear who is responsible
    * earn trust from people 
        * do what you say, do what you're committed to
        * behaviour must be predictably pleasant
    * help people trust each other
        * communication and commitment
        * respect them - give them the environment to try - others built also trust on their skills
    * trust yourself
        * you can only trust others if you trust yourself
    * respect
        * know what people think about you - ask for feedback
        * what is it that I should stop doing
        * what is it that I should start doing
        * what is it that I should continue doing
    * and give feedback
        * be somehow in the topic (at least at an high level)
* organization structure
    * ordered
        * no creativity and innovation
        * no empowerment
        * bureaucracy - behaviour is regular and predictable
    * complex
        * employees often don't empower themselves - they are empowered by managers
    * chaos
        * self empowerment - not structured and predictable


### who or what is tuning the rules in an organization {#who-or-what-is-tuning-the-rules-in-an-organization}



* misconception is that managers do it
* managers are not responsible for self orga
* its the managers job to make sure that the people can create their own rules together
* one responsibility is the development of a self organizing system
* alignment of constraints - and protection of the system
    * protect people and shared resources - make sure they're treated fairly
* self- orga needs a boundary around it
* make sure that what emerges has value to you and the environment
* you don't manage the people - you manage the system
* define the direction of the self-organizing system
* short - tasks
    * develop the system, protect the system, direct the system


### leader {#leader}



* a complex system does not need a single leader - needs more leaders by topic
* a cross-functional team functions better when it has multiple leaders - each with own area(s) of interest
* rulers - law making. enforcement and sanctioning
* football - leaders are the teams best players  -  rulers are the referees
* managers are leaders and rulers 
    * do also governance(administrative leadership) - like hire/fire
    * what projects to work on, how much they are going to earn, what clothes to wear
* leader - agree, advise, inquire
* ruler - tell, sell, consult


### purpose and goals {#purpose-and-goals}



* every living system has an intrinsic purpose (comes naturally to a system)
* every living system can have an extrinsic purpose - assigned to it by an owner
* every living system can have an autonomous purpose - assumed by itself
* the goal of the team is not a result of the goals of its team members but of the interaction between the team members
* shareholder value is NOT the goal of an organization (its the goal of the shareholder)
    * an organization has many stakeholders - each with their own goals
* friedman - was not aware of the complex system - when he said shareholder value is the only goal of an organization
    * shareholder value is an outcome - not a strategy
* whatâ€™s the purpose of a software team?
    * intrinsic - product software
    * extrinsic - (defined to have the boundary and allow self orga to take place in the right direction) - needs to be defined by the manager 


# how to align constraints {#how-to-align-constraints}



* goal - only an extrinsic or autonomous purpose; if intrinsic use better - meaning
* the team should have/get a shared goal  - examples:
    * next year we're going to win the Best Product award for our industry
* checklist for agile goals - pick some of them that you find important to the current situation:
    * specific and understandable that people know what it means
    * simple and concise that it fits on a small sticky note
    * manageable and measurable that success can be determined
    * memorable and reproducible that it can be communicated to others easily
    * attainable and realistic to have a chance to achieve it
    * ambitious and stimulating so that it isn't too easy to achiv
    * actionable and assignable to turn it into specific actions
    * agreed upon and committable that people feel responsible for it
    * relevant and useful that people care about it
    * time-bound and time-specific that people know when to do it
    * tangible and real to see the effects of achieving it
    * excitable and igniting that people are motivated to do their best
    * inspiring and visionary to see the bigger picture
    * value-based and fundamental that it builds on company values, team values or personal values
    * revisitable and assessable to reassess its applicability later


## Goals {#goals}


### goal don'ts {#goal-don'ts}



* not created to intimidate people and threaten them (with loss of their jobs)
* not defined merely to impress shareholders or people watching the orga from the sideline
* should not favour short term wins over long term losses
* should not distract people from a desired outcome by focusing only on the action plan
* not too many goals


### agile goals (in difference to old goals) {#agile-goals-in-difference-to-old-goals}



* higher purpose - transcends goals of all individuals (not only CEO or shareholders)
* goal depends on its context
* should not be connected to rewards or incentives - should address intrinsic desires (as learned from Drive - extrinsic motivation often destroy creativity)
* should give employees a sense of direction


#### communicate your goal {#communicate-your-goal}



* you raise the pressure and make it transparent


## ASK - Do you still know what your goal is? How is this action going to help us in achieving our goal?


### vision statement  {#vision-statement}



* created for business, projects and products
* outward facing
* deals with place the system has in the world and the change it will bring to its environment
* is about the desired end state
* paint picture about delighted users, market domination, world peace


### mission statement {#mission-statement}



* used for groups and teams
* inward facing
* steering the internal dynamics of a system
* is about the way to get to an end state
* talk about technical excellence, innovative achievements, defeating the competition


### allow team to have an autonomous goal {#allow-team-to-have-an-autonomous-goal}



* you need to map other goals with it
* other goals should not overrule the team autonomous goal
* team must find it on their own - never tell them to create their own goal


### use boundary list of authority {#use-boundary-list-of-authority}



* table with key decision area, how (authority level- see above), whe (team/individual)
* avoids that people run into hidden electrical fences - helps to keep them motivated and productive
* set authority level to lowest possible level


### protect people {#protect-people}



* self organizing system must not be fair (see kids group)
* manager promotes self organization but also needs to protect people
* ask - Who are your friends there to get a feeling if the member is integrated


### manage shared resources {#manage-shared-resources}



* otherwise it leads to the tragedy of the commons - work the four ingredients:
    * institutions
        * work on building trusting relationships between competing systems - to increase acceptance of common rules
    * information
        * that increases the understanding of the physical and social environment - reduce uncertainty
    * identity
        * increase one's sense of community and reduce competition
    * incentives
        * reward responsible use, punish overuse


### quality {#quality}



* you need to put the right and clear constraints in place to enforce quality 


### social contract for orga {#social-contract-for-orga}



* freedom to voice your opinion
* professional development
* nondiscrimination
* help


### team - rules {#team-rules}



* agree on the team's direction; don't go at it yourself (alignment)
* don't collide with team members and prevent problems (separation)
* work together with the team; don't single yourself out (cohesion)


### some agile manager principles {#some-agile-manager-principles}



* culture - no matter what other methods you apply to achieve competence in a social system - in the end it all depends on whether people actually care
* instructors - teach people how to do their jobs properly - again, and again and again
* drivers license - require that people are properly tested before allowing them to participate in (challenging) projects
* traffic signs - decrease the chance of problems in your teams by using smart and proactive tools, checklists, alerts, notifications
* traffic police - have a process manager walking around whose job it is to make samples of the results in your projects and check whether the quality output is produced
* car horn - make sure your team members have guts to tell each other how to improve their daily work
* government - management will need to clean up the mess


### feedback loops {#feedback-loops}



* positive feedback loops - effect increases itself
    * you need to recognize feedback loops - enables to understand why an orga can get stuck in a certain kind of behaviour
* negative feedback loops - system counteracts by slowing down the change
    * when an organization grows, the amount of overhead increases with the square of its size, whereas the horsepower of the orga grows only linearly
* can bring stability to a system
* intentional feedback loops in a short cycle are often better than in long cycles


### Competence - discipline * skill {#competence-discipline-*-skill}



* discipline
    * importance of discipline is evident
    * skipping discipline makes you go slower (you produce technical dept) 
    * maturity levels
        * oblivious (vergesslich) - we even don't know that we perform a process
        * variable - we do whatever we feel
        * routine - follow our routines (except when panic)
        * steering - choose among routines
        * anticipating - establish routines based on past experience
        * congruent - everyone is involved in improving everything all the time
* skill
    * novice, advanced beginner, competent, proficient, expert
    * skill differs from discipline and must be developed separately
* create a skill - discipline matrix
    * maturity can be measured with those two dimensions
    * managers must take care of both dimensions
* rules
    * behaviour of a team is guided by rules
    * each team member maintains his own set of rules
    * avoid senseless synch of rules - give them freedom - it motivates
    * competing rules in a team can strengthen the whole
    * good rules are adopted by all team members
* subsidiarity - organizing principle that things should be handled by the smallest, lowest or least centralized competent authority
    * responsibility of individual worker unless he cannot perform its tasks effectively - then establish the rule on the next higher level
        * e.g. follow your own rules of writing unit tests unless the team can prove that its more effective to establish centralized rules
    * people can make rules on their own - they don't need managers for that
    * please explain me why your higher level rules are more effective than my individual rules
* avoid precautionary principle - when something might go wrong make a new law to prevent it from happening
* you achieve the best results if your create your own rules on the spot - approriate for the situation of the day
    * the best way to implement agile processes is to do it your own way (wailgum 2007??)
* memeplex - collection of interdependent memes (pair programming, refactoring, iterative development)
    * e.g. Christman, Scrum, agile software development
    * practices in a memeplex tend to reinforce each other (positive and negative feedback loops!)
    * is much stronger than the individual memes
    * help to copy it as a bundle between peoples minds
        * it can be easier to get people adopt multiple ideas, concepts and practices simultaneously
        * not all ideas, concepts and practices need to be beneficial - the bad ideas still could help to copy the good ideas 
        * the removal of individual memes may weaken or destroy the strength of the memeplex
        * multiple competing memeplexes may reinforce each other (e.g. XP, Scrum, Kanban - draw intention the agile brands in general)
        * memes can appear in different memeplexes
* broken window theory (signs of disordery and petty behavior trigger more disorderly and criminal behaviour - causing the behavior to spread)
    * behaviour = function of person and his environment -- people tend to adapt their behaviour to the environment they live in
    * bad behavior is likely to lead to more bad behaviour 
    * big problems often start small
    * if a problem is too big to handle - target another related but smaller problem


### How to develop competence? {#how-to-develop-competence}



* maturity models are too narrowly focused on processes
    * an orgas capability of learning and processes is measured but not the capability of being innovative and adaptive in a complex environment
    * applying one rank to an entire orga is useless - there are many different topics to consider in complex systems - and every part needs a ranking
        * instead classify specific activities performed by specific people

approaches to competence development (should begin with the first approach - and the followers are fallbacks) - competency stack:



* self
    * self discipline and self development - refer to one's own initiative
    * its part of the behaviour I have adopted myself and that I intend to stick to
* coach
    * training a person to develop specific skills and behaviours
* tests
    * some authority verified that a person has the necessary skills and behaviour
* tools
    * signs and signals to steer peopleâ€™s behaviour
* peers
    * influence by a group to encourage a person to change her behaviour
* supervisors
    * making sure - on behalf of an orgas managment that people are doing their jobs
* manager
    * its about setting good examples and about ruling and judging in some cases


#### sub-optimization principle {#sub-optimization-principle}



* if each subsystem, regarded separately, is made to operate with maximum efficiency, the system as a whole will not operate with utmost efficiency
* conclusion: always optimize the whole
    * what you measure and constrain has to cover everything
    * global metrics over local metrics
        * metric of individual performance should be combined with metrics on team leam level should be combined with metrics on business unit ...


### 7 measurable dimensions of software development {#7-measurable-dimensions-of-software-development}



* functionality (story points completed)
* quality (problems reported)
* tools (costs per month)
* people (impediments reported by team members)
* time (days remaining until live release)
* process (checklists completed)
* value (increase in users per minute)


#### performance metrics {#performance-metrics}



* distinguish skill from discipline
    * helps skilled people to think about discipline and vice versa
    * discipline: task-board is up to date  skill: few bugs reported, no build failures, customer demos always accepted
