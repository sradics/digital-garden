# Maturity Model for my Obsidian Notes
Based on the [great input from Nitin Pai](https://notes.nitinpai.in/Colophon/Bean)

# Epistemic status
"how much I think I know" about something.

+ First, we know things with different levels of certainty.
+ Second, what we think we are certain about itself varies in accuracy.
+ Third, facts change over time.

my notes fall into these levels: nut 🌰 → seedling 🌱 → potted plant 🪴 → tree 🌳 → ancient tree 🍁 → fallen leaf 🍂

# Current maturity model
[[Developing a Zettelkasten]]

I recently found a better visualisation that is also more suiting with the idea of a digital garden. And I can also better visualize it.

Order is:
+ Nut 🌰
+ Seedling 🌱
+ Potted plant🪴
+ Tree 🌳
+ Ancient 🍁
+ Fallen leaf 🍂

## Nut 🌰
#epstatus/0-🌰
Initial question, thought, idea. Should be a fleeting note or early stage literature note, like a just captured book note.

Something that came to mind but has not been developed. 

## Seedling 🌱
#epstatus/1-🌱
A note is "seedling" 🌱 when I have started working on it, but do not think it is ready for sampling. Likely this is a fleeting note. It can also be a permanent note that I just extracted from a literature note.

Or a literature note where I did a first stage processing.

It could be factually wrong, inaccurate, misleading, a dead end, a red herring, a wild-goose or worse, the germ of a brilliant idea that will change the Universe forever. Who knows?

## Potted plant 🪴
#epstatus/2-🪴
A note is a "potted plant" 🪴 when I have worked on it for a while and think it is already in a mature state so that building on top of that is valuable. So you can consume it with greater confidence. 

## Tree 🌳
#epstatus/3-🌳
A note is a "tree" 🌳 when I think it has reached a high maturity state. So you can consume it with high confidence. 

## Ancient Tree 🍁
#epstatus/4-🍁
A note is an "ancient tree " 🍁 when knowledge becomes outdated and I might need to rethink original thought. 

## Fallen leaf 🍂
#epstatus/5-🍂
An note is a "fallen leaf" 🍂 when it is not longer valid or not useful. I will not likely not put further love to it. At the same time I'm not yet fully convinced to remove it entirely. It can still be linked. 


# Previous maturity system
I replaced that system because it was not connecting well with my digital garden analogy and I also did not find proper icons that I can easily used in my Second Brain to visualise a status for a note. I keep it still in this note as reference for other who might like that alternative verions

my notes falls into five non-linear levels: [Bean](https://notes.nitinpai.in/Colophon/Bean) → [Brewing](https://notes.nitinpai.in/Colophon/Brewing) → [Brewed](https://notes.nitinpai.in/Colophon/Brewed) → [Overbrewed](https://notes.nitinpai.in/Colophon/Overbrewed) → [In-the-Sink](https://notes.nitinpai.in/Colophon/In-the-sink)


## Bean

![[bean.png|100]]

Bean is the primary raw material for a cup of coffee. It may be fresh or roasted. And there are different kinds of roast: light, medium and dark.

In these notes, a note with the status of "bean" implies that it is a new, undeveloped idea. Something that came to mind but has not been developed. 

It could be factually wrong, inaccurate, misleading, a dead end, a red herring, a wild-goose or worse, the germ of a brilliant idea that will change the Universe forever. Who knows?


## Brewing
![[brewing.png|100]]
The process of brewing is complex, has several variables that can be tweaked, several untweakable and involves time and effort

A note is "brewing" when I have started working on it, but do not think it is ready for sampling. You might smell the coffee at this stage, but it is premature to consume.


## Brewed

![[brewed.png|100]]

Coffee is brewed when its maker had decided that the brewing is complete. It is filtered in one way or the other and poured into a cup. You can smell the coffee and taste it too. While it is ready for consumption, the aroma and flavour will change with time.

A note is brewed when I think it has finished brewing. So you can consume it with greater confidence. That said, metaphors take us only so far, and I might decide that it needs some more brewing.

## Overbrewed
![[overbrewed.png|100]]
A note is overbrewed when I revise and modify what I had previously considered brewed. I do it because I think it will improve, but I might have made things worse.

## In-the-sink
A note is in-the-sink when I have discarded it -- either because it is ruined, past the expiry date, is a royal mess or stinks.
