# Meeting Types

## Synchronization Meetings (Sync)

- Short, regular meetings to synchronize the team
- Exchange of work-relevant information that is important for everyone
- Frequency depending on the team's needs, e.g. daily, every 2 days or weekly

## Problem Meetings

- Serve to understand complex problems and break them down into sub-problems
- Each person contributes individually first, before working together
- The goal is to develop a common understanding of the problem

## Solution Meetings

- Building on the insights from the problem meeting
- Ideas and solution proposals are collected and evaluated here
- Also individual idea collection before the common exchange

## Decision Meetings

- Serve to make decisions in a structured way
- Options are evaluated based on criteria such as effort and benefit
- The goal is to make well-founded decisions

## Retrospective Meetings
