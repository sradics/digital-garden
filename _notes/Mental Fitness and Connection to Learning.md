Mental & Physical Fitness is Crucial for your Learning  
(My 30-Hour Work Nightmare showed me that)  
  
When you want to learn, mental fitness is as important as physical fitness.  
I learned this the hard way. 😓  
  
I once worked for 30 hours straight on a database upgrade,  
including a night shift.  
After those 30 hours, I needed to make a final SQL update!  
But my mind was foggy. I was so tired and exhausted, I couldn’t think straight.  
Have you ever felt so exhausted that your brain couldn’t function?  
  
It was a nightmare and a clear lesson: our minds need rest to function well.  
  
If you want to stay sharp and absorb new information,  
here are my top recommendations:  
  
🔹 Regular Exercise boosts your cognitive function and emotional well-being  
For the past three years, I’ve done a 60-100 minute exercise routine daily:  
→ to think through complex topics and  
→ use the diffused mode of learning  
  
🔹 High-Quality Sleep:  
Sleep is your brain’s best friend. Sleep:  
→ cleans up your brain  
→ helps you digest what you’ve learned  
→ regenerates you for a fresh start  
  
Without enough sleep, your cognitive abilities and mental health suffer.  
Do you get enough high-quality sleep?  
  
🔹 Mental Fitness: Practices I recommend include:  
→ meditation  
→ coaching  
→ psychological guidance  
  
Talking through challenges can provide valuable insights and improve your learning process. How often do you take time for your mental fitness?  
  
Holistic learning isn’t about gaining knowledge only!  
It’s about maintaining balance and well-being.  
  
By prioritising fitness, you make:  
→ your learning journey sustainable and enjoyable  
→ prevent burnout and promoting long-term engagement  
  
Prioritise your mental and physical fitness.  
Your future self will thank you for the investment.

Main topic:
+ claim: mental & physical fitness is essential for learning
+ Story: I once worked for 30h on an important database upgrade. It included a nightshift. After 30 hours I had to implement an important final SQL-Update and it was just impossible to catch any clear thought. I was so tired, so exhausted and it felt terrible. This was for me a clear connection, that our mind need rest in order function properly. 

When you want to learn a topic mental fitness is as crucial as physical fitness. Maintaining and enhancing cognitive abilities, emotional regulation, and psychological well-being is essential for long-term success.

Invest in:
+ regular exercise - I arrived at a 60-100' exercise routine daily, that I established for the past 3 years. And it does wonders to my ability to think though topics and use the diffused mode of learning.
+ high quality sleep - to clean up our brain, to digest what we learned in focused mode, to re-generate and start with a fresh mind the next day
+ mental fitness e.g. through meditation, coaching, psychological guidance. Talking through a challenge can provide so many more insights.

Holistic learning isn’t just about gaining knowledge; it’s about maintaining balance and well-being. 

By prioritizing fitness, you ensure your learning journey is sustainable and enjoyable, preventing burnout and promoting long-term engagement.
