Turn information into fortune  
  
Warning: This hack is too powerful for most professionals  
  
"Compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world.  
He who understands it, earns it;  
he who doesn't, pays it."  
  
But what if you applied this to knowledge?  
  
Over the past weeks, I provided a trace to compounding:

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”  
  
7 posts, thoughts connected, compounding at play.  
  
â†’ Each post fed the next.  
â†’ Ideas grew, connected, multiplied.  
â†’ Comments sparked new insights.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
Then it hit me. The hack too powerful for most:  
The Knowledge Flywheel!  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
â†’ Learn  
â†’ Share  
â†’ Get feedback  
â†’ Gain new perspectives  
â†’ Repeat  
  
Why is this too powerful for most?  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ It demands consistent effort. No shortcuts.  
â†’ It requires vulnerability. Sharing unfinished ideas is scary.  
  
But for those who dare?  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Your skills will develop rapidly  
â†’ Your insights will grow exponentially  
â†’ Your network will propel you forward  
  
Next week Wednesday, we take this flywheel for a spin.  
From written words to live interaction.  
  
Join my "Learning That Pays Dividends" workshop  
âž  free to attend, but limited seats (and this is no boring Webinar!)  
  
Comment or DM "5" - and I'll send you the details

The list of posts I got from my Second Brain.Â I asked via AI:  
"Can you please shortly recap my recent LinkedIn posts about the compounding effect? With name and link"
