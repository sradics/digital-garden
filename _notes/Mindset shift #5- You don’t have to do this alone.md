## Highlights
* To my amazement, there was a thriving underground scene of small, informal ‚Äúinterest clubs‚Äù organized through the website Meetup.com.
* And at yet another meetup, I was introduced to the Theory of Constraints, which became my most prolific source of insights on productivity.
* Why not go along with our sociability instead of fighting it? Why not double down on the collaborative aspect of creativity in a hyperconnected world? Why not proactively adopt methods that leverage people‚Äôs gifts and perspectives instead of treating them as threats to our ego?
* calls ==‚Äúintellectual loneliness.‚Äù It‚Äôs a feeling that almost no one in your social circles shares the same passion for ideas as you.==
* I ==teach my course the way I do: live, in real time, on video, with a two-way exchange of ideas instead of a one-way lecture.==
* What are the ==benefits of social learning==?
	* ==learn vicariously through others‚Äô parallel experiences==, which means you ==learn far faster than figuring out everything yourself.==
	* You get to ==learn by teaching others and giving them feedback on their work==. 
	* And you get to know people as holistic human beings, not just faceless avatars.
* ==learning in community is that you have the opportunity to be generous==.
	* You get to see your own contributions make an impact on real people.
* When we learn together, we automatically seem to ==adopt a mindset of generosity, gratitude, open-mindedness, and appreciation==.
