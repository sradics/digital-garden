### More insights on diversity

Team diversity, such as teammates being of different genders, only benefits performance when the work involves nonroutine cognitive tasks. These tasks could include things like research, planning, strategy, and problem-solving.

When a teamâ€™s work involves routine tasks, where stability and efficiency are the biggest predictors of success, then homogenous, nondiverse teams perform best.

Diverse teams make more accurate predictions, generate a greater number of high-quality ideas and opinions, think more critically, are more creative, and are better at discerning truth from falsehoods than homogenous teams are
