[Source](https://www.blinkist.com/en/nc/reader/the-confidence-code-en)

## What is confidence about
* **==_confidence_, the belief in our abilities==** vs.Â **==_competence_, the knowledge of our qualifications in a certain field==**
* confidence means having **==belief in own abilities that we become active==**
* Confidence shows in being more sociable and taking more risks

## Why does confidence matter
TheÂ business world requires a certain amount of self-promotion and self-initiative. ==We have to getÂ _ourselves_Â noticed==.

## Consequences of lower confidence
* if we lack confidence, we prefer to **==stay inactive==**
* being uncertain of whether our efforts will be successful â€“ that **==makes us scared to even try==**
* if they have good ideas they are less likely than men are to propose them to the boss
* negative self-perception caused by lack of confidence can cause women to **==miss opportunities==**


## What causes woman to be less confident
* confidence is determined by our specific **==genetic== makeup** **and ==environmental factors==**
* genetic make-up determines up to 50 percent of our confidence
* **==girls are often raised to be more diligent and to follow directions==** more often than boys, which makes them less confident. So they can **become perfectionists and less likely to take risks**.
* Women tend to overthink things and not to act.

## Comparing to men
* demonstrate confidence by being more aggressive
* quicker and more energetic and determined at expressing their opinions
* Women tend to collaborate with others and be more humble.
* men negotiate their salary four times more often than women

## What can one do to influence confidence
* **==Being optimistic==** does help, though, as it **==can lead to action==** which improves confidence
* **==stand behind your opinions==** and defend your point of view ... it doesnâ€™t matter if you do it aggressively or not
* getÂ _ourselves_Â noticed.
* We must understand that **==taking action is essential to confidence==**.
* Consider **==failures as opportunities==** to better yourself

Being confident means **==not letting fear of failure prevent you from trying to get the things you desire.==**Â 

Life experiences physically alter our genesâ€™ shapes and cause them to function differently.
+ We have the power to change which memories our brain accesses. **==Create alternative thought patterns==** to avoidÂ _automatic_Â _negative_Â _thoughts_
