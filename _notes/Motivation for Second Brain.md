# Motivation for Second Brain
We consume a huge amount of information, but fail to leverage it to grow our knowledge. 🤯

We pay for books/courses/studies and invest hours but we don't make it stick. What a waste! 🗑️

Building a Second Brain teaches a better way  — Capture, Organize, Distill and Express information to grow our knowledge and far better leverage information and time/resource investments.  🧠

Combining that theoretical foundation with using Obsidian for implementing big parts of a Second Brain is a powerful combination. 💡

Let's maximize our potential and make the most of the vast amounts of information we have access to by leveraging the this powerful combination. 🚀
