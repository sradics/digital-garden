Are you a WHAT learner too? 🔍✨  
(Discover how understanding your learning style can amplify your growth!)  
  
Based on the 4MAT Learning Types,  
I’m a strong WHAT learner – Style 2 – Analytic.  
This means I lean towards thinking and involve my left brain hemisphere.  
When I learn, I balance between Doing/Exercising and Watching/Observing.  
  
My learning type is characterized by:  
———  
→ Examining cause and effect  
→ Learning by thinking through ideas  
→ Collecting objective data and critiquing information  
→ Applying critical thinking, analyzing, and seeing connections  
→ Needing to know what things are and breaking them down into parts  
  
No wonder I’m growing a Second Brain!  
  
When I present, explain, or teach, I:  
——  
→ Provide significant information presented systematically  
→ Transmit knowledge as accurately and knowledgeably as possible  
  
I lead by:  
——  
↳ Respect for others  
↳ Emotional intelligence  
↳ Logical argumentation  
↳ Clarity and confidence  
↳ Using positive language  
↳ Creating WIN-WIN approaches  
↳ Embedding non-verbal communication  
↳ Tackling topics with rationality and logic  
↳ Exercising authority with assertive persuasion and knowing the facts  
  
To stretch further, I aim to:  
——  
🧪Trust my instincts more  
🧪Dare to experience chaos  
🧪Take more risks and action earlier  
  
Imagine the impact of designing trainings that match different learning types. I’m on it with my training about 4MAT. Stay tuned for optimized training sessions!
