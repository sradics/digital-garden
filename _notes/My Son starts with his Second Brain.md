I bridged a generational gap.

â†’ Yesterday my eldest son asked me THE question. 

He starts studying this week.
He wants to organize his stuff. 

He asked, "Can you show me how to use this thing you do?"

That thing where you put all your information in. 
And where you connect everything. 

You know what I'm talking about, right?

My son wants to use a Second Brain too! Yay!!!

What a great moment to start with.

We set up Obsidian on his iPad.
With Obsidian one can grow a ðŸ§ ðŸ§ 

Took us about 10 minutes. 

I provided him with a template to start with. 
It is a preconfigured Second Brain. 

Took us about 10 minutes.

â†’ We shortly ran through the CODE
CODE explains how information flows.

Capture - Organize - Distill - Express,
a core of the Second Brain approach.

â†’ I showed him the basics of PARA

PARA is about organizing information by actionability.
In Projects - Areas - Resources - Archives. 

â†’ We created the first areas and projects
â†’ And practiced taking notes and linking them

We closed with a highlight of using Excalidraw
A plugin in Obsidian

â†’ To create Visual Notes
â†’ To embed notes and drawings
â†’ To create presentations, to be creative

All in all, he now has a Starter setup.
2 hours spent well. Now it's time to apply.

I'm looking forward to his growing experience. 

What is ONE hint you would give a fresh student?
