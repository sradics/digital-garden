## Content preparation
For a long time I did not work with PodCasts. I perceived it as too much talking to less insights. And I was wrong! The change came for me when I was watching a PodCast episode by Andrew Huberman and his interview with David Goggins on How to build Immense Inner Strength. The shared insights, the flow of the conversation and the genius perceived from both was deeply touching me. 
That was my moment of discovery. So far, my drive for efficiency blurred my mind. 

Now I discovered:
+ There is high value in the dialog and emotions expressed. It is direct, it is spontaneous, it is less filtered.
+ There is a vast amount of knowledge transported. As fresh knowledge that might be expressed just months to years later via articles or books.
+ Or via deep reflections, that are otherwise deeply hidden in books, that take much longer to grasp.
+ It touches me. More than e.g. written content. The connection with voices running through my body. Seeing expressed emotions. It just connects to more senses.
+ It is especially the combination of Podcast with interviews and done with a video version. I need the picture to grasp the emotions.
+ The quality bar is high is inspiring. These podcasts show a great interview style, sound and video quality, where I can also learn on Meta Level about story telling, interview techniques, technical setup and approaches to connect marketing
+ I can work with support of technology to further process Podcast insights. Like listening with higher speed and getting a distilled version afterwards. 

So I'm now on my journey to explore the PodCast world. And I would love to get your recommendations. What is your favorite podcast episode that I should listen to next? Please share in the comments.
