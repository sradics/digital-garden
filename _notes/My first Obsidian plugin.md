3 clicks to import entire courses into your Obsidian vault

â†’ Weekend Project: My First Obsidian Plugin

I built my first Obsidian plugin over the weekend - a small tool that seamlessly integrates course materials directly into your Obsidian vault.

The plugin lets you:
â€”â€”â€”
â†’ Configure a folder for storing course module files
â†’ Provide a URL to download your course module (works with zip files)
â†’ Automatically fetch all essential content - session summaries, presentations, and more

I'm currently using it for my Learning Ecosystem Mastery course materials, making it effortless for participants to work with insights directly in their Second Brain.

With course materials embedded in Obsidian, you can leverage powerful note-taking and linking capabilities to connect new content with your existing knowledge base.

This plugin represents what I love about building a Second Brain - creating systems that reduce friction and enhance learning.

P.S.

The video demo was created with Descript:

â†’ Writing a draft script
â†’ Getting an AI transcript
â†’ Using AI voice for narration
â†’ Screen recording the demo

Tiny Experiment mode ...

P.P.S
Now I'm waiting for Plugin approval. I'll share once it is  available for download.
