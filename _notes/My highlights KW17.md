From Hypergrowth to Anti Productivity Hacks
(Top 5 LinkedIn Posts I Loved This Week)

This week for me was about:

â†³ Understand your team and where to focus
â†³ About hierarchies and situational awareness
â†³ No more ToDo list? What does the Guru say? ðŸ˜ƒ
â†³ Building a LinkedIn Assistant GPT in just 4 hours
