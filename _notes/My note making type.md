I blend Action-First, Topics-First, and Daily Notes

â†’ But Iâ€™m on a plateau, and the next peak is in sight

I recently discovered an excellent overview of various note-taking approaches. It made me reflect on my current way of working with notes. 

Let's look at five different note-taking types.
â€”â€”â€”
â†’ Random Mess
Notes recorded all over the place. 
Not really connected. 
You trust that search will find them. 

â†’ Daily Notes First
You store everything in a daily note. 
Might be extended with a weekly/monthly/yearly summary.

â†’ Action first with PARA
You organize your notes by actionability using a folder structure with:

(P)rojects
Highest actionability. Topics with a goal and timeline. 

(A)reas of responsibilities
Topics without a defined timeline, but a goal.

(R)esources
Notes as reference. Action mainly later connected when used in Projects or Areas

(A)rchives 
Notes to keep, but with no current actionability.

â†’ Content First with atomic notes
You create a note each time you work on something. 
You partially connect notes with each other.

â†’ Topic first with Maps of Content
(with special version of using a Zettelkasten)
You work with index notes for each topic and link notes.

â€”â€”â€”

Looking at these classifications made me realize:
I currently blend Action First with topics first and daily notes.

I discovered that I do not yet use the approaches to their full potential. 

For instance in my usage of PARA:
â†’ I can improve in following the actionability aspect.

Daily notes feed my projects. They also feed other topics. 
At the moment it is more free-floating and random. 
â†’ Next, I'll add a little more structure too.

It feels like looking from a plateau. 
I climbed the mountain of working with notes regularly. 

Now I can see the next level I'd like to reach. 

To achieve a level of compounding knowledge that helps me to achieve my goals faster, smarter and with more joy. 

What is your preferred note-taking style?
