My path forward with writing

â†’ I built "Lexicon"

It named itself "Lexicon": 'Given my nature as The Writing Voice Architect - a living library-workshop hybrid that bridges complex ideas into accessible wisdom...'

Lexicon is built on:
â†’ Deep analysis of my voice (15 hours of live voice samples)
â†’ Comprehensive writing knowledge (1500+ pages)

Voice + Knowledge = Writing Assistant that understands my context.

Now it teaches, mentors, and coaches me to write better. 
In my voice. 
Learning step by step to deliver my message more effectively.

I'll share how Lexicon was created in the comments.

What's your favorite AI assistant?
Don't have one yet? What's stopping you from building your first one?
