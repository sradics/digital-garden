Her approach in brief:  
  
‚Üí you use Obsidian for note-taking and connecting thoughts  
‚Üí you take extensive notes while working through learning material  
‚Üí you apply progressive summarization with several stages of highlighting  
‚Üí to prepare for exams, you use spaced repetition, embedded in Obsidian

‚Üí you create Visuals with the Excalidraw plugin in Obsidian  
  
This smart learning system amplified my wife‚Äôs progress on many levels:  
  
Through:  
  
‚Üí Creating visuals  
‚Üí Reading and writing  
‚Üí Making spaced repetition cards  
‚Üí Repeating several times before exams  
  
She passed each exam on the first attempt!

## Content preparation

This year my wife excelled and mastered her one year study and became a certified facility management specialist (Fachwirt for Facility Management).

It was a challenging, learning intense education. With a lot of learning material to work through and one exam to pass each month. 

My wife applied learning with a Second Brain. I assisted with set up and first steps.

Very brief:
+ She used **Obsidian** as her ***foundation*** for note taking
+ While working through her learning material she took extensive notes
+ To fast repeat, she **==applied progressive summarization==** with several steps of highlighting
+ to prepare for exams she used spaced repetitions, embedded in Obsidian. Spaced repetition cards used notes directly
+ visuals to explain aspects where done with the Excalidraw plugin in Obsidian

Through that system learning happened on multiple levels:
+ through reading and writing
+ through creating visuals 
+ through creating the learning cards for spaced repetitions
+ through repeating several times before the exams

She passed each examen with the first attempt.
And mastered her education after one year. Hard work. 
Facilitated with structured, smart learning. 

Congratulations dear Nadine.

Now she has a Second Brain filled with highly distilled and tailored learnings from her studies. Retaining knowledge with high speed. She can build on that knowledge daily at her work.

A great example for levelling up your approach to learning. The investment in better learning is amortising already while you learn. 

Convinced and want to take your next step in better learning.
