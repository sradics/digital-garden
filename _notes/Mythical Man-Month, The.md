## Highlights
Finally, there is the delight of working in such a tractable medium. The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. — location: [293](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=293) ^ref-10933

---
Adjusting to the requirement for perfection is, I think, the most difficult part of learning to program. — location: [305](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=305) ^ref-10648

---
The obsolescence of an implementation must be measured against other existing implementations, not against unrealized concepts. — location: [323](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=323) ^ref-51111

---
More seriously, they reflect an unvoiced assumption which is quite untrue, i.e., that all will go well. Second, our estimating techniques fallaciously confuse effort with progress, hiding the assumption that men and months are interchangeable. — location: [332](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=332) ^ref-34732

---
schedule progress is poorly monitored. — location: [335](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=335) ^ref-31184

All programmers are optimists. — location: [341](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=341) ^ref-37285

---
But however the selection process works, the result is indisputable: "This time it will surely run," or "I just found the last bug." — location: [343](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=343) ^ref-9170

---
For the human makers of things, the incompletenesses and inconsistencies of our ideas become clear only during implementation. — location: [352](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=352) ^ref-33417

---
writing, experimentation, "working out" are essential disciplines for the theoretician. — location: [353](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=353) ^ref-8673

---
A large programming effort, however, consists of many tasks, some chained end-to-end. The probability that each will go well becomes vanishingly small. — location: [363](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=363) ^ref-22438

---
Cost does indeed vary as the product of the number of men and the number of months. Progress does not. Hence the man-month as a unit for measuring the size of a job is a dangerous and deceptive myth. — location: [366](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=366) ^ref-21184

---
Men and months are interchangeable commodities only when a task can be partitioned among many workers with no communication among them ( — location: [368](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=368) ^ref-2494

---
The bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned. — location: [373](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=373) ^ref-26877

---
the effort of communication must be added to the amount of work to be done. — location: [378](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=378) ^ref-39485

---
Each worker must be trained in the technology, the goals of the effort, the overall strategy, and the plan of work. — location: [382](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=382) ^ref-17060

---
If each part of the task must be separately coordinated with each other part, the effort increases as n(n–1)/2. — location: [384](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=384) ^ref-49451

---
If, moreover, there need to be conferences among three, four, etc., workers to resolve things jointly, matters get worse yet. — location: [386](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=386) ^ref-53890

---
Time versus number of workers—task with complex interrelationships — location: [389](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=389) ^ref-62657

Therefore testing is usually the most mis-scheduled part of programming. — location: [396](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=396) ^ref-18544

---
1/3 planning 1/6 coding 1/4 component test and early system test 1/4 system test, all components in hand. — location: [398](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=398) ^ref-52312

---
Failure to allow enough time for system test, in particular, is peculiarly disastrous. Since the delay comes at the end of the schedule, no one is aware of schedule trouble until almost the delivery date. — location: [407](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=407) ^ref-1020

---
Furthermore, delay at this point has unusually severe financial, as well as psychological, repercussions. The project is fully staffed, and cost-per-day is maximum. — location: [409](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=409) ^ref-61699

---
and the secondary costs of delaying these are very high, — location: [411](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=411) ^ref-27553

But false scheduling to match the patron's desired date is much — location: [419](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=419) ^ref-17721

---
It is very difficult to make a vigorous, plausible, and job-risking defense of an estimate that is derived by no quantitative method, supported by little data, and certified chiefly by the hunches of the managers. — location: [420](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=420) ^ref-54039

We need to develop and publicize productivity figures, bug-incidence figures, estimating rules, and so on. — location: [422](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=422) ^ref-50780

The two new men, however competent and however quickly recruited, will require training in the task by one of the experienced men. — location: [449](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=449) ^ref-28705

---
The temptation is very strong to repeat the cycle, adding yet more manpower. Therein lies madness. — location: [460](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=460) ^ref-5218

---
Oversimplifying outrageously, we state Brooks's Law: Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later. — location: [464](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=464) ^ref-40132

---
The number of months of a project depends upon its sequential constraints. The maximum number of men depends upon the number of independent subtasks. — location: [467](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=467) ^ref-15327

---
These studies revealed large individual differences between high and low performers, often by an order of magnitude. — location: [471](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=471) ^ref-27746

---
Within just this group the ratios between best and worst performances averaged about 10:1 on productivity measurements and an amazing 5:1 on program speed and space measurements! — location: [480](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=480) ^ref-20955

---
The data showed no correlation whatsoever between experience and performance. (I doubt if that is universally true.) — location: [482](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=482) ^ref-50236

---
This, too, suggests that one wants the system to be built by as few minds as possible. — location: [485](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=485) ^ref-34357

---
a 200-man project has 25 managers who are the most competent and experienced programmers, fire the 175 troops and put the managers back to programming. — location: [487](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=487) ^ref-47351

with the small, sharp team concept: it is too slow for really big systems. — location: [496](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=496) ^ref-61183

---
Assume the same team stays on the entire job. Well, 5000/(10 x 7 x 7) = 10; they can do the 5000 man-year job in 10 years. — location: [499](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=499) ^ref-5669

---
Mills proposes that each segment of a large job be tackled by a team, — location: [506](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=506) ^ref-48051

---
Few minds are involved in design and construction, yet many hands are brought to bear. — location: [509](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=509) ^ref-19625

by making all the computer runs visible to all team members and identifying all programs and data as team property, not private property. — location: [534](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=534) ^ref-59898

---
Each team will need its own toolsmith, regardless of the excellence and reliability of any centrally provided service, — location: [544](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=544) ^ref-3095

---
The tool-builder will often construct specialized utilities, catalogued procedures, macro libraries. — location: [545](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=545) ^ref-42565

---
Second, in the conventional team the partners are equal, and the inevitable differences of judgment must be talked out or compromised. — location: [562](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=562) ^ref-47274

But how is the surgical team concept to be used on large jobs when several hundred people are brought to bear on the task? — location: [574](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=574) ^ref-11891

---
depends upon the fact that the conceptual integrity of each piece has been radically improved—that — location: [576](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=576) ^ref-50797

---
So it is possible to put 200 people on a problem and face the problem of coordinating only 20 minds, those of the surgeons. — location: [577](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=577) ^ref-6555

---
Let it suffice here to say that the entire system also must have conceptual integrity, — location: [579](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=579) ^ref-35886

---
a sharp distinction must be made between architecture and implementation, — location: [580](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=580) ^ref-28859

---
most programming systems reflect conceptual disunity far worse than that of cathedrals. — location: [598](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=598) ^ref-62830

---
but from the separation of design into many tasks done by many men. I will contend that conceptual integrity is the most important consideration in system design. — location: [599](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=599) ^ref-40088

---
Ease of use is enhanced only if the time gained in functional specification exceeds the time lost in learning, remembering, and searching manuals. — location: [613](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=613) ^ref-4544

---
The separation of architectural effort from implementation is a very powerful way of getting conceptual integrity on very large projects. — location: [634](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=634) ^ref-26701

---
The architect of a system, like the architect of a building, is the user's agent. — location: [639](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=639) ^ref-4827

---
"Where architecture tells what happens, implementation tells how it is made to happen." — location: [642](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=642) ^ref-55594

---
Won't one get a better product by getting the good ideas from all the team, following a democratic philosophy, rather than by restricting the development of specifications to a few? — location: [655](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=655) ^ref-42445

---
that the conceptual integrity of a system determines its ease of use. Good features and ideas that do not integrate with a system's basic concepts are best left out. If there appear many such important but incompatible ideas, one scraps the whole system and starts again on an integrated system with different basic concepts. — location: [658](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=658) ^ref-60744

---
If a system is to have conceptual integrity, someone must control the concepts. That is an aristocracy that needs no apology. — location: [662](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=662) ^ref-9843

---
In an unconstrained implementing group, most thought and debate goes into — location: [673](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=673) ^ref-37286

---
architectural decisions, and implementation proper gets short shrift. — location: [674](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=674) ^ref-52132

---
"We finally decided to implement the language unchanged and unimproved, for the debates about language would have taken all our effort." — location: [676](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=676) ^ref-42734

---
Many actors, of course, entered into that mistaken decision; but the overwhelming one was schedule time and the appeal of putting all those 150 implementers to work. It is this siren song whose deadly hazards I would now make visible. — location: [688](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=688) ^ref-64938

---
The specifications will be too rich in function and will not reflect practical cost considerations. • The architects will get all the creative fun and shut out the inventiveness of the implementers. • The many implementers will have to sit idly by while the specifications come through the narrow funnel that is the architecture team. — location: [692](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=692) ^ref-19877

---
implementation is also a creative activity of the first order. — location: [697](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=697) ^ref-29777

---
A quick answer is to refrain from hiring implementers until the specifications are complete. This is what is done when a building is constructed. — location: [699](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=699) ^ref-8182

How much can specification and building be overlapped? — location: [701](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=701) ^ref-38459

He can begin designing data flows, control sequences, gross packaging concepts, and so on. — location: [705](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=705) ^ref-26084

---
If one separates responsibility for functional specification from responsibility for building a fast, cheap product, what discipline bounds the architect's inventive enthusiasm? The fundamental answer is thoroughgoing, careful, and sympathetic communication between architect and builder. — location: [723](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=723) ^ref-27543

---
An analogous process governs the architect of a computer system or a programming system. He has, however, the advantage of getting bids from the contractor at many early points in his design, almost any time he asks for them. — location: [730](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=730) ^ref-39871

---
In practice, early and continuous communication can give the architect good cost readings and the builder confidence in the design without blurring the clear division of responsibilities. — location: [733](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=733) ^ref-1633

---
cut the design or challenge the estimate by suggesting cheaper implementations. — location: [735](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=735) ^ref-58367

---
remember that the builder has the inventive and creative responsibility for the implementation; so the architect suggests, not dictates; — location: [737](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=737) ^ref-22135

---
deal quietly and privately in such suggestions; • be ready to forego credit for suggested improvements. Normally the builder will counter by suggesting changes to the architecture. Often he is right—some minor feature may have unexpectedly large costs when the implementation is worked out. — location: [740](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=740) ^ref-37991

---
This second is the most dangerous system a man ever designs. — location: [748](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=748) ^ref-55361

---
The general tendency is to over-design the second system, using all the ideas and frills that were cautiously sidetracked on the first one. — location: [751](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=751) ^ref-25456

---
That is a tendency to refine techniques whose very existence has been made obsolete by changes in basic system assumptions. — location: [765](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=765) ^ref-34063

---
How much better the system would have been if the TESTRAN effort had been devoted instead to building the interactive and fast-compile facilities earlier and better! — location: [783](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=783) ^ref-59200

---
How does the architect avoid the second-system effect? — location: [789](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=789) ^ref-37427

---
But he can be conscious of the peculiar hazards of that system, and exert extra self-discipline to avoid functional ornamentation and to avoid extrapolation of functions that are obviated by changes in assumptions and purposes. — location: [790](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=790) ^ref-4632

---
assign each little function a value: — location: [792](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=792) ^ref-6511

How does the project manager avoid the second-system effect? By insisting on a senior architect who has at least two systems under his belt. — location: [794](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=794) ^ref-21958

Written Specifications—the Manual — location: [803](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=803) ^ref-19684

it is the chief product of the architect. — location: [806](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=806) ^ref-37603

---
This tends to make manuals dull reading, but precision is more important than liveliness. — location: [813](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=813) ^ref-50779

---
but the casting of those decisions into prose specifications must be done by only one or two, — location: [815](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=815) ^ref-24707

I think we will see future specifications to consist of both a formal definition and a prose definition. — location: [831](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=831) ^ref-63892

"Never go to sea with two chronometers; take one or three." — location: [833](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=833) ^ref-43299

The Backus-Naur Form is familiar for language definition, — location: [837](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=837) ^ref-55111

So all questions of definition can be resolved by testing it. — location: [850](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=850) ^ref-17307

advantages. All questions can be settled unambiguously by experiment. Debate is never needed, so answers are quick. — location: [851](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=851) ^ref-59840

Answers are always as precise as one wants, and they are always correct, by definition. — location: [852](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=852) ^ref-16607

first is a weekly half-day conference of all the architects, — location: [873](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=873) ^ref-44526

---
Anyone can propose problems or changes, but proposals are usually distributed in writing before the meeting. — location: [874](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=874) ^ref-50388

---
The group attempts to invent many solutions to problems, then a few solutions are passed to one or more of the architects for detailing into precisely worded manual change proposals. Detailed change proposals then come up for decisions. These have been circulated and carefully considered by implementers and users, and the pros and cons are well delineated. If a consensus emerges, well and good. If not, the chief architect decides. — location: [876](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=876) ^ref-19471

---
The formality of written proposals focuses attention, forces decision, and avoids committee-drafted inconsistencies. — location: [887](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=887) ^ref-15237

---
The clear vesting of decision-making power in the chief architect avoids compromise and delay. — location: [888](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=888) ^ref-5377

To settle these we held annual supreme court sessions, lasting typically two weeks. — location: [891](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=891) ^ref-5737

---
One useful mechanism is a telephone log kept by the architect. In it he records every question and every answer. Each week the logs of the several architects are concatenated, reproduced, and distributed to the users and implementers. — location: [915](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=915) ^ref-18008

In the merciless light of real use, every flaw will show. — location: [921](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=921) ^ref-41913

Well, if they had all of these things, why did the project fail? Where did they lack? In two respects—communication, and its consequent, organization. — location: [945](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=945) ^ref-52083

Shortly the clans began to move apart, preferring isolation to wrangling. — location: [948](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=948) ^ref-50557

So it is today. Schedule disaster, functional misfits, and system bugs all arise because the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. — location: [950](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=950) ^ref-57797

---
How, then, shall teams communicate with one another? In as many ways as possible. — location: [956](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=956) ^ref-44426

---
Informally. Good telephone service and a clear definition of intergroup dependencies will encourage the hundreds of calls upon which common interpretation of written documents depends. — location: [957](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=957) ^ref-10219

---
Meetings. Regular project meetings, with one team after another giving technical briefings, are invaluable. Hundreds of minor misunderstandings get smoked out this way. — location: [959](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=959) ^ref-20250

project workbook is not so much a separate document as it is a structure imposed on the documents that the project will be producing anyway. — location: [963](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=963) ^ref-21540

The early design of the project workbook ensures that the documentation structure itself is crafted, not haphazard. — location: [970](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=970) ^ref-19834

The second reason for the project workbook is control of the distribution of information. — location: [972](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=972) ^ref-21935

If there are n workers on a project, there are (n2–n)/2 interfaces across which there may be communication, and there are potentially almost 2n teams within which coordination must occur. — location: [1014](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=1014) ^ref-20147

The total cost of maintaining a widely used program is typically 40 percent or more of the cost of developing it. Surprisingly, this cost is strongly affected by the number of users. More users find more bugs. — location: [1395](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00B8USS14&location=1395) ^ref-47548

The debugging improvement comes from the fact that there are fewer bugs, and they are easier to find.

How does one control a big project on a tight schedule? The first step is to have a schedule. Each of a list of events, called milestones, has a date.

There is no substitute for a PERT chart or a critical-path schedule. Such a network shows who waits for what. It shows who is on the critical path, where any slip moves the end date.

Conversely, when the manager knows his boss will accept status reports without panic or preemption, he comes to give honest appraisals.

Changes made in the program do not promptly, accurately, and invariably appear in the paper. The solution, I think, is to merge the files, to incorporate the documentation in the source program.
