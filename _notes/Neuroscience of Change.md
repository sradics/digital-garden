### Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

Maslow's model is often depicted as a pyramid and includes the following levels, from bottom to top:

1. **Physiological Needs**: Basic needs for survival, such as food, water, and shelter.
2. **Safety Needs**: Needs for security and safety.
3. **Love and Belonging Needs**: Needs for affection, relationships, and belonging.
4. **Esteem Needs**: Needs for self-esteem, respect, status, recognition, and freedom.
5. **Self-Actualization Needs**: The need to realize oneâ€™s full potential and seek personal growth and peak experiences.

### Pankseppâ€™s 7 Emotional Systems

Panksepp identified seven primary emotional systems in the brain:

1. **SEEKING**: Encompasses the urge to explore, learn, and extract resources.
2. **RAGE**: Associated with frustration, anger, and aggression.
3. **FEAR**: Linked to anxiety, worry, and behaviors associated with avoiding harm.
4. **LUST**: Tied to sexual desire and behaviors.
5. **CARE**: Involves nurturing, caring for others, and forming social bonds.
6. **PANIC/GRIEF**: Related to feelings of loneliness and loss.
7. **PLAY**: Connected to joy, playfulness, and relaxation.

### Possible Correlations

- **Physiological Needs and SEEKING**: The SEEKING system could be activated when individuals are motivated to fulfill basic survival needs, such as searching for food or shelter.
    
- **Safety Needs and FEAR**: The FEAR system directly correlates with safety needs. When safety is threatened, fear responses are triggered.
    
- **Love and Belonging Needs with CARE and PANIC/GRIEF**: The CARE system is active in forming attachments and social bonds, which are crucial for love and belonging. Conversely, the PANIC/GRIEF system might be activated when these needs are not met, leading to feelings of loneliness or loss.
    
- **Esteem Needs with SEEKING and PLAY**: The SEEKING system can drive individuals to achieve and gain recognition, fulfilling esteem needs. The PLAY system might also be involved, as it can relate to social status and esteem gained through social interactions and achievements.
    
- **Self-Actualization Needs with SEEKING and PLAY**: Fulfilling self-actualization needs may involve the SEEKING system as individuals explore and realize their potential. The PLAY system might also be relevant, as creativity and experimentation can be parts of self-actualization.
    
- **LUST and Love/Belonging Needs**: The LUST system is clearly linked to romantic and sexual relationships, which are part of the love and belonging level in Maslow's pyramid.
    
- **RAGE and Esteem/Safety Needs**: The RAGE system may be activated when an individual's esteem is threatened or when there is a direct threat to their safety.

+ Note: I can do that with Excalidraw
+ does not have an order
+ grows around a main theme
+ add a title and date
+ identify high, medium and low beliefs
	+ high: cause so much pain that you would do anything to avoid that
	+ medium: serious discomfort
	+ pick the associations that you want to replace and find replacement words or short phrases

### Worst Case Scenario - WCS modeling
+ do it in writing
+ reflect on a change that is causing a discomfort

	+ what emotions would I experience
	+ How would I change it?
	+ separate facts from thoughts

# Week 3 - Building a new Mindset
## Stories we tell ourselves
Negative stories we tell ourselfes:

Ask: Is it a story or a fact?

	+ connect that with an anchor - e.g. a clap of your hands, or turning your ring 2 times
	+ should be something unique
	+ get into peak state, set the anchor - and repeat several times
