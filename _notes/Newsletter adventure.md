Warning: This newsletter may cause extreme learning enthusiasm

âž  Skip the LinkedIn scroll. Join the deep-dive revolution.

Over the past six months, I've learned a lot about writing on LinkedIn.

I observed:
â†’ The platform thrives on a skimmable, brief format
â†’ It supports scrolling and fast value delivery

However, I've also realized that LinkedIn isn't suited for deep dives.

Depth requires space, not speed. 
The platforms built for breadth seldom nurture profound exploration.

Have you ever wondered about my posts?

â†’ Why am I so enthusiastic about learning?
â†’ What exactly is this Second Brain concept?
â†’ Why do I keep mentioning new tools without enough context?
â†’ Holistic learningâ€”what is it, and why should it matter to you?

I often feel my message misses the bigger picture and lacks detail.

Let's bridge that gap. 

I'll cover the bigger picture and dive deep with my newsletter. 
The first edition will be sent this Friday at 13:00 CET. 

Join me as we explore:
â†’ My life lessons about Learning that connect joy, fear and passion
â†’ Deeper insights into growth mindset and learning approaches
â†’ The role of AI in learning

Curious? Great! 

Join our journey and sign up for my newsletter at:
https://pages.quintsmart.com/ 

Sign up today and receive a special gift for your LinkedIn journey.

For those who subscribe before the first newsletter is sent, I'll include a LinkedIn Second Brain you can download and use immediately.

See you in the deep-dive?
