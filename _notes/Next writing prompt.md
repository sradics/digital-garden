## Making the most of remote work
### What are the benefits of remote work for you personally
The main benefit is that I can work with my current energy levels in a high level of freedom. I can **start really early**, do a first round of productive, thinking. Then do my exercises and continue with a next chunk of working. Sometimes time is rushing to the lunch and I get a lot done. **When I feel like I'm tired**, I now formed a habit of **taking a power nap. Just 10-20 minutes** with high relaxation. I can then work much better and longer on topics.
Another huge benefit is the **lower energy consumption by distraction** and also by commute. In direct comparison I can now say how much energy is just taken, when I need to get to the office instead of starting directly on my home remote setup. **With having that setup highly equipped and streamlined I can dive into working really fast**. Highly focussed and with drive on progress.

### Have you experienced any drawbacks
A main drawback is the **controlled switching off**. Even though I'm not really sure how much switching off is actually necessary, especially because I'm combining my passion with what I'm working. **Sometimes I need to really force myself to go to bed** because I know that otherwise my next day won't be on high energy. The same is for building a habit around regular exercises.

I **drink a lot more coffee**. But actually I'm not yet sure if I need to change that.

I have much **more accountability for myself** and can't rely on others holding me accountable. It sometimes is very **appealing to follow a certain knowledge path**. Also when that leads away from the original goal to reach.

The **level of appreciation and feedback is lowered**. At the same time I'm not sure if that is related to remote work or due to changing positions where direct team work on a topic was not longer my main focus.

### How can you mitigate these challenges
I mitigate these challenges by having a **clear rhythm f**or my physical exercises. And I **have strong goals** that help me, like my goal to reach at least 2000 minutes of exercising time per month. Regarding stopping work and also spending time on my other life, I recently **started to learn and integrate more of Ikigai** an valuing also the small moments in life. And I know about roughly my hours needed for good sleep. If I overdo it on one day I take it a little more relaxed the next day. I usually have an orientation around the 5AM club and this also drives my main behavior. But I got a little more flexible with it.

Regarding coffee I do observe myself and how I'm reacting to it. I'll further check, if I actually need to change my behavior.

**To stay on track I already work with projects and timelines**. They provide an orientation and help with observing deviations. I think **I need to learn even more to work with PARI.**

Regarding level of appreciation I recently learn about Ikigai and valuing the small things too. And also to **detach myself from external rewards, where I'm dependent on others.** Only when this means to get direct feedback from a customer, then I should further invest. But for other feedback I can either ask directly or just remove my thoughts of expecting that.

### Do you feel less creative when working remotely?
I feel much **more creative because most of the distractions are gone**. I have creativity tools around my, like recently **ChatGPT**, my **Second Brain**. If I need input from my colleagues I can reach out to them and plan for a conversation. And I can also meet them in person (partially) in the office. 
I also added further conversations with friends and colleagues from previous jobs and this further opens my creativity. **My investment in learning how to learn and especially valuing and leveraging the diffuse mode** of learning was another angle to foster creativity. 
I would say that **I'm today by far more creative than I have been 10 years ago.** And that mainly through my new understanding of creativity, having a flexible mindset and leveraging tools and approaches that support creativity.

### What are some practical strategies to make remote working for you?
I applied the following practical strategies to make remote working for me.

I mainly use a **strict rhythm starting by the 5Am Club** approach of getting up early and combining Learning, Wisdom and Sports. I **invested in exercising capabilities** with low setup efforts using my Peloton, nearly every day. 
I **organized my home office setup** with a second screen, mircophone, good light, a Loupedeck, my Remarkable, external keyboard and touch pad. All makes it super fluent to work. 
I **automated many of my lower level tasks**. What also would work for onsite work. But combined with my Loupedeck automation this is already stronger in my remote setup.

I **invest a little more in my Task Management**, using Todoist. In combination with working with my Second Brain, that I grow in Obsidian, this is a strong tech stack to do productive work.
**Learning about building a Second Brain and applying its organizing principles and information processing approach helps me a lot to work with compounding knowledge and have an easier exchange with people around the globe**. I still need to become stronger in my weekly planning and weekly review. This is not yet in my habits so that I fully leverage its strengths.

To stay in close connection with what is going on in my team, we invested in **building a structure of information management that works for teams** and is orienting on Building a Second Brain. We did harmonize the way we store information, the way we document projects and tasks and our way of communication as a team. This makes it very efficient to follow conversations and allow for faster switching times between topics.
