8h work, 8h sleep, only 8h left

â†’ sorry, but we have no time to learn
â†’ I hear us say as the main problem
â†’ The less time it seems at first
â†’ The higher the surprise is
â†’ Once we zoom in

Agree with: 
â†’ Let's never cut on quality time. 
â†’ Relaxation, Fitness, Family
â†’ Work to an extent too

Nothing left then right?
Not really!

Here are 3 irritations I want to create:
Let's kill our time eaters and learn instead!

We speak about 30' per day for learning, OK?!

Can you imagine:

â†’ To STOP with DOOMSCROLLING
â†’ To REDUCE "just NEWS" consumption
â†’ To revisit our mindless entertainment habit

I bet once you examined just these 3

âž  You win back 1h per day at least

Let's use this 1h as QUALITY TIME, please! 

I'm sure you'll spent the first 30' wisely ðŸ˜‰ 

And let's speak about the 30' for learning
I might have some surprises for you!
