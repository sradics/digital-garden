His $249 course beats even his book  
  
â†’ Last Saturday I got my invite for [SÃ¶nke Ahrens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soenkeahrens/) course How to take Smart Notes with Obsidian  
  
And what should I say - SÃ¶nke delivers.  
  
This course provides such a solid foundation for taking notes, all based on the Zettelkasten method made famous by Niklas Luhmann.  
  
I read SÃ¶nke's book: How to take Smart notes in 2022.  
It shaped my whole career path. Connected me deeper to writing and learning through expressing my thoughts.  
  
But with the course, you can spot the difference between reading a book and having something even more tangible to learn from.  
  
I'm 58% through the course, eating every lesson, and here's what hooks me:  
  
â†’ SÃ¶nke's crystal clear explanations. Never experienced such focused descriptions.  
  
â†’ It makes sense. Provides me deep insights on my note-taking practice.  
  
The differentiation between Fleeting Notes, Permanent Notes, Literature Notes and Project Notes is super helpful. Even after years I still struggled with how to best integrate that in my system. Now that's resolved.  
  
SÃ¶nke's deep dive into Index Notes, Hubs and Maps of Content is groundbreaking. It eases navigation and "talking" to your system.  
  
And finally I got Zotero installed. A reference manager that makes linking and managing sources solid and easy.  
  
I learned more about note-taking in the past 2 days than I had in a long time. I'm thankful that SÃ¶nke externalized his wealth of knowledge.  
  
Price is currently at $249 (will increase in July to $329).  
I'm not an affiliate, but I'm a real fan.
