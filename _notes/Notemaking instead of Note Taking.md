From passive notes to active insights.

â†’ Start making your notes matter.

Today's post started with fragments.
Fragments of note making instead of note taking. 

It is a flashlight of my thoughts. 
So follow my journey.

I make a note.

Make vs. Take.
The difference is huge.
One approach is active, one is passive.

When I take a note

â†’ I write down what I hear
â†’ I consume and store
â†’ I move on fast
â†’ I learn less

When I make a note

â†’ You write down what you think
â†’ You add your context
â†’ You connect dots
â†’ You learn

Nick Milo said: 

"Create tension so that you can resolve the tension"

Make your note a little uncomfortable by:

â†’ adding your immediate thoughts
â†’ adding your questions about the topic
â†’ by linking that note with not yet related items

Ask:

â†’ How might that insight help me with [Topic]
â†’ What do I already know about this topic?
â†’ What does [fuzzy word] really mean?

By Note-Making you:

â†’ go from Consumer to Creator
â†’ from Spark to Remark
â†’ emergence appers

âž  You think

What is ONE note you made recently?
