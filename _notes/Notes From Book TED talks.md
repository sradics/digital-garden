Chapter 2: **Earn** your audience‚Äôs **trust by making eye contact** **and showing your vulnerability.** [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/ted-talks-en?chapter=2)
- One is to get personal,
- disarm your audience to make them receptive to your message;
- Making eye contact and showing vulnerability can go a long way toward opening people‚Äôs minds.
- making **eye contact** with your audience will **let them see that they can trust you.**
- Suppose you‚Äôre a trustworthy person who has based their talk on facts. Most people will be able to determine this by simply watching your eyes
- if you ‚Äúdisarm‚Äù yourself by showing that you‚Äôre vulnerable, they will let down their guard

Chapter 3: You can explain even complicated ideas using a **five-step process.** [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/ted-talks-en?chapter=3)
- 1) **find your audience‚Äôs starting point.**
	- begin with something that will definitely be relevant to them
- 2)  **spark their curiosity**
	-  people start asking themselves ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù or ‚Äúhow?
- 3) **go over your concepts one at a time**
	- it‚Äôs never a good idea to explain everything at once.
- 4) **deploy some metaphors**
- 5)  **use examples to make your speech vivid and memorable.**

Chapter 4: If you use **visuals,** they **should be strong and illuminating.** [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/ted-talks-en?chapter=4)
- if your talk is on a highly personal subject, you probably don‚Äôt want to distract your audience with slides.
- many talks do benefit from some visual aids, as long they‚Äôre strong ones that reveal, explain and appeal to your audience
- **images** are secondary to words and should always **reveal something that words alone can‚Äôt**
- check that they also illustrate exactly the concept you are describing and nothing else.
- Stick to **one idea per image**

Chapter 5: **Your personal style dictates whether to use a script or not**. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/ted-talks-en?chapter=5)
- a script ensures that you can fit everything you wish to say into the given time frame
- helps you structure your thoughts
- enable you to analyze if there are easier, more compelling ways to explain your ideas
- Speaking spontaneously will give your talk a more fresh and vivid tone.

Chapter 6: **Consider what you wear**, but not too carefully. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/ted-talks-en?chapter=6)
- ask the host of the event if there‚Äôs a dress code
- it‚Äôs **not** a great idea to **wear all white or black**
- **avoid dense and small patterns** that can create a shimmery effect in videos
- it‚Äôs essential to wear an outfit that feels right for you

Chapter 7: Channel your adrenaline. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/ted-talks-en?chapter=7)
- Just think of your fear as motivation to practice your talk
-  remember to **breathe and breathe deeply**
	- breathing all the way into your stomach and slowly exhaling will fill your body with oxygen, bringing on a sense of calm
- **drink water. When adrenaline surges through your body, you might start to feel dehydrated.**
- **spot a friendly face or two in the audience**
	- people will start to feel connected to you. Feeling this will excite them and, in turn, feed your confidence as well as calmness.

Chapter 8: Final summary [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/ted-talks-en?chapter=8)
- make sure to **vary your voice.**
	- using tools like volume, tone and timbre
