# Notes for Keine Sinnfragen, Bitte
Source: [[Keine Sinnfragen bitte! - Gunter Dueck]]

## Research with early results get abandoned and leads to inertia
Research is done at an early stage and leads to insights that cannot be leveraged immediately because it in addition will need infrastructure and market forming. For example solar panels years ago where cost intense in production and companies abandoned it.

Companies who experience that often resignate and don't touch this area again. [^1]

> [!danger]
> The wrong learning in companies - Don't touch that topic again. We already failed last time. 

## Excellence leading to blindness
> [!important]
> Do you know (all) the startups around you that can kill your business?

And do you seriously consider their approach? Companies must avoid positioning as superior from their current success [^2].

## About meetings
> [!tip]
> Just don't go to meetings where you don't know the value provided. [^3]

As simple as this sounds, still most join meaningless meetings where purpose it unclear, no value is created and life time is wasted. Dare to do not go there and spent your time valuable.

+ Use [[Liberating Structures]] for creating meaningful working sessions
+ Make meetings optional (connection with[ Scrum 3.0](https://ontheagilepath.net/articles/Scrum%2030%20and%20Organization%2040%20%20impressions%20from%20a%20great%20evening%20with%20Boris%20Gloger%20at%20ImmobilienScout24.pdf))

## About presentations
> [!attention]
> Presentations are a waste time & effort and create marginal outcomes, if at all  [^4]

+ Presentation must be tailored to the culture, sub-culture of the audience. It does not matter that much to follow best practices for good presentation but one need to match the cultural expectations
+ Time invested in preparing presentation often exceeds time spent with the audience. 
+ Distracting  incentives like *airtime*, *status* lead to blown presentations.

## Be aware of your Lighthouse Projects
The shiny new tool, the shiny new project, the shiny new approach. By looking at how others are doing it, companies copy approaches. 
Eg. working with a "Turn-Agile-Tiger-Team". This new approaches create some fresh air, brings some new ideas but as soon as it needs the real work to  scale and create value it is not longer that interesting and is stopped.

> [!warning]
> Instead of now tackling it and really creating values, let's think about what else might be something new to try out next 

> [!important]
> One needs to consider that the costs of scaling it to production ready are often 10-100 times higher than the first "promising" prototype. [^5]
