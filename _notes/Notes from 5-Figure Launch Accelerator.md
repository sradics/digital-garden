*Source:* [Build to impact](https://programs.builttoimpact.com/courses/take/five-figure-launch-kit/lessons/34731493-designing-your-five-figure-launch-plan)
+ Launch - a planned effort to bring a new product to market
+ analysis of audience, core message
+ people need to see something 21 times!
+ planning (2w) - pre-launch 2-3w - open cart 1-2w - post launch

## Pre-Launch
Build assets:
+ Sales page
+ Checkout page
+ eMail content
+ Social Media Content
+ etc

+ Promotion of main content starts ... raise awareness with clients about your existence and expertise
+ Make systems ready to accept clients
+ Promotional phase around 10-14 day
## Main Event
+ Webinar, Masterclass, Challenge etc  - see also [[Day 1 - Session notes#Approaches for Signature gathering]]
## Launch Phase aka enrollment period
+ people can purchase my offer
+ main focus on selling 
+ 7-10d
+ the launch is not over until it is over
+ people often buy in the beginning or at the end (1-2 days range)
+ actively show up during the launch phase
## Launch Date
+ the first day of your offer
## Open-Cart-date
+ day when you open the cart and make your offer available for enrolling
+ typically on the day of the main event
+ on a 5 days challenge this might be e.g. on day 3
## Open enrollment period
+ starts with [[#Open-Cart-date]] and then e.g 7-10 days

## Close cart date
+ final cart close date

## Post launch phase
+ send last minute eMails to collect data from audience that did not buy
+ do a post launch debrief
+ Onboard & welcome new members - publicly (FOMO) and internally
+ Build a waitlist for people who did not buy

## Some metrics
+ Registration conversion = Total registrations / Audience Size 
*audience size - e.g email list of subscribers*

+ Attendee conversion = total number of attendees / total number of registrants
+ Total sales conversion = total number of sales / total number of attendees
+ Total launch revenue = number of sales in currency
+ Total cash collected = Actual money paid to you 

## Launch goals
Based on the metrics you can define your launch goals
