- **logos ‚Äì refers to the logical basis of your argument, which can include statistics or other data** 
- **pathos ‚Äì is concerned with the emotional connection you make with your audience.**
- most popular presentations consist of **==65 percent pathos, 25 percent logos and 10 percent ethos==**.

The best way is through storytelling.
- **storytelling** helps you to **connect with your audience** by making your presentation **less abstract** and **more identifiable**

- third type is a **story about successful** brands, companies or organizations

- paying attention to your body language
- a leader should **stand straight, displaying confidence**, at all times
- public speakers: they should stand tall in front of their audience, demonstrating confidence in their ideas.
- certain studies have associated a speaker‚Äôs gestures with the amount of confidence an audience places in that speaker.

- Also, save your most expansive gestures (such as spreading your arms at their widest) for emphasizing only your most important points.

Chapter 5: To make your **presentation surprising and unforgettable,** give your audience **new information.** [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/talk-like-ted-en?chapter=5)

Chapter 8: Presentations should cover **no more than three aspects in 15 to 20 minutes.** [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/talk-like-ted-en?chapter=8)
- Keep your presentation short. This makes it far easier for audiences to remember the content.
- Presentations at TED conferences usually take 18 minutes, which is considered a good length as it fits perfectly in the optimum period of 15 to 20 minutes.
- should not cover more than three separate themes.
- most people have little trouble remembering seven pieces of new information.
- revised this theory and have divided that figure into **three or four basic information units ‚Äì or ‚Äúchunks.‚Äù**
-  aspects can be organized in a message map.
- **‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the single most-important message I want my audience to take away?‚Äù**
- write that message at the top of a piece of paper 
-  **find the three (or fewer) messages which support your headline message**, and list them underneath it
- outline their specific content: the ‚Äúmeat‚Äù of your presentation.

Chapter 9: **Stimulating all of the senses** during a presentation helps your audience to remember your ideas. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/talk-like-ted-en?chapter=9)
- We remember things more vividly when we experience them with all of our senses.
- **multisensory environments (videos, texts and images)** are better able to recall information
-  you should communicate in a way that appeals to more than just one sense. 
- use pictures to support your presentation
