# Notes from Crashcourse Zettelkaste for Beginners

[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxREbrWzP8w)
Step 1..4 from [[Zettelkasten - Taking Smart Notes - Notes from a video by Joshua Meyer]]

Comment: Why does it matter to have a separate Literature note and a permanent note?
* to capture where a thought came from

Further note types beside Literature notes and permanent notes

## Fleeting Notes

+ throw away notes/thoughts that just came on the fly
+ difference to literature notes is more that they are more our own thoughts
+ and they are note yet permanent notes because they are note yet phrased in high quality
+ also for notes that just act as reminders... 
+ the can be thrown away after processing

## Project Notes

+ Notes connected with projects. 
+ Later on one can recheck and extract further permanent notes
+ used to not pollute my permanent notes

## Map of Content

[[MOCs Overview]]

## Some guidlines

+ write the note for yourself
+ write for long term usage
+ be consistent in processing
+ make notes atomic
+ extract the common concept
	+ comment: makes the note more compatible with other notes (but might also dilute the note)
+ use sentences as titles
	+ forces to bring key insight to the surface and enforces concept of atomic notes
	+ makes it better embeddable in floating text
+ use links inside the text (so my chapter with Linking is not yet the best approach)
+ think of connections with other notes
+ ensure each notes is easily reachable

# Templates, tags, folders

[Chapter 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9FXrz-xvlk)

## Folders

+ to distinguish private and public areas
+ to bundle topics
+ to have project related topics
+ see [[PARA Method Notes]]

## Tags

+ for note type (Fleeting, Permanent, Literature,...)
+ for status
+ work with nested tags eg. note type/status

# Observations

+ When working with tags I can better visualize that in the graph view of Obsidian (vs. working with folders)
	+ to further improve that beside using tags on can also add something like }b for book note to the notes title
