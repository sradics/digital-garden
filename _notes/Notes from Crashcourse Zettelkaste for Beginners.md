Step 1..4 from [[Zettelkasten - Taking Smart Notes - Notes from a video by Joshua Meyer]]

Comment: Why does it matter to have a separate Literature note and a permanent note?
* to capture where a thought came from

Further note types beside Literature notes and permanent notes

## Fleeting Notes
+ throw away notes/thoughts that just came on the fly
+ difference to literature notes is more that they are more our own thoughts
+ and they are note yet permanent notes because they are note yet phrased in high quality
+ also for notes that just act as reminders... 
+ the can be thrown away after processing

## Project Notes
+ Notes connected with projects. 
+ Later on one can recheck and extract further permanent notes
+ used to not pollute my permanent notes

## Map of Content
[[MOCs Overview]]

## Some guidlines
+ write the note for yourself
+ write for long term usage
+ be consistent in processing
+ make notes atomic
+ extract the common concept
+ use sentences as titles
+ use links inside the text (so my chapter with Linking is not yet the best approach)
+ think of connections with other notes
+ ensure each notes is easily reachable

# Observations
+ When working with tags I can better visualize that in the graph view of Obsidian (vs. working with folders)
	+ to further improve that beside using tags on can also add something like }b for book note to the notes title
