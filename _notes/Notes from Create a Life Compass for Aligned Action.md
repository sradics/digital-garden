## Dreams
> [!note] Dreams
> Dreams are specific and achievable but ambitious. It is important that we do not forget the things we want to achieve, no matter how crazy or distant they may seem.
> **Dreaming is a muscle that must also be exercised.**

+ Write yourself a list of about 100 dreams (and don't get excessive with ticking them all off)

## Quarterly projects
+ can go with the season
+ values/dreams/12 favs/daily inspiration inform the projects
+ long enough, so that you can close things and also short enough to not go too long in  maybe wrong direction
+ What would you like to live and experience during the next 3 months of your life?
+ Set goals that are concrete, achievable, connected (to values, 12 favs, dreams) and mine
+ Write 3-4 actions already in the beginning, to get it started
