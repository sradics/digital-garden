# Notes from Das erschoepfte Gehirn - The exhausted brain
[Source](https://www.blinkist.com/en/nc/reader/das-erschopfte-gehirn-de) Author: Michael Nehls

Ego Depletion - the exhausted brain. Caused by overloading our brain, not having enough time to recharge and several factors that do not support brain cell growth and renewal.

## How to support Neurogenese and brain relaxation
> [!note] Definition [Neurogenese](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurogenese)
> Renewal of brain cells (especially in Hippocampus) 

+ Sports and regular body activity (produces several supporting hormons)
+ Enough sleep (supports flushing Hippocampus storage and creating new brain cells)
+ Omega 3 rich nutrition (Algen√∂l)
+ Social interaction and body contact (supports Oxytocin production)
+ avoid Nicotin, Alcohol, Cannabis (this blocks brain cell creation)
+ avoid added sugar (leads to inflammations)
+ reduce continuous stress
+ continuous learning (as without learning our body stops/reduces production of new brain cells) - *You lose, what you don't use* 
	+ New experiences and connected with strong emotions leads to new brain connections
+ avoid too much meaningless/repetitive activities
	+ it is tiring our brain and at the same time does not lead to new brain connections as their is now learning embedded. So it actually leads to shrinking brains.
	+ Note: this might connect with e.g. passive watching TV, passive usage of Mobile Phones 
 
Neurogenese also works with higher age. 

## System 1 and System 2
The Hippocampus has limited daily capacity. When full our brain switches to working more with System 1. Consequences are:
+ tendency to prejudice
+ not being able to find rational solutions for complex problems as deep thinking is blocked
+ lowered self steering

Interesting side note: to solve complex problems, system 2 also uses sensations, emotions and memories.

## Connection with Building a Second Brain
[[MOC Building a 2nd brain| Building a Second Brain]] supports by freeing up storage and leaving capacity in Hippocampus for doing creative work and solving complex problems. Therewith building a Second Brain avoids exhausting our brain with activities we don't really need our brains for.

Claim: Our brains are for having ideas, not for storing them
