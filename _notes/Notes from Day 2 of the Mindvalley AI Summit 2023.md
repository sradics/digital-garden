### Customize to unique needs - Working with Image Hooks
> [!tldr] Prompt
> ok these are not bad. But the images are to common. I want you to think of how these images can be almost poster like and unusual. The images can contain elements of pop-art or optical illusions. They should be vivid and colorful to grab attention. The scenes in them can be unusual or funny. What are elements that make a photo or piece of art capture attention? 

+ focus on capturing attention! - really cool

> [!tldr] Response
> Some elements that make a photo or piece of art capture attention are:
â€¢ Bold and contrasting colors that pop and stand out.
â€¢ Unique perspectives or unusual angles that create visual interest. Unusual or unexpected subject matter that grabs the viewer's attention.
Intricate patterns or textures that create depth and intrigue. â€¢ Creative use of lighting or shadows to create a dramatic effect.
â€¢ Playful and whimsical elements that evoke emotions and create a sense of fun or
Joy.
Clever use of negative space or optical illusions that create a sense of mystery or Intrigue.
â€¢ Dynamic composition that creates movement or draws the eye to a focal point.
Symbolism or metaphorical elements that create deeper meaning or convey a message.
With these elements in mind, I can modify the prompts I created earlier to make them more visually striking and attention-grabbing. 

> [!tldr] Further Response
> ChatGPT Response:
To create attention-grabbing, poster-like images that incorporate elements of pop-art or optical illusions, focus on the following aspects:
Bold, vivid colors: Use high contrast and saturated colors to make the images stand out and draw the viewer's attention.
Unusual or surreal scenes: Incorporate unexpected or fantastical elements that challenge the viewer's perception of reality.
Humor: Adding humorous or quirky elements can make an image more memorable and engaging.
Strong composition: Use dynamic compositions and leading lines to guide the viewer's eye through the image.
Repetition and patterns: Utilize repeating shapes, patterns, or elements to create a sense of rhythm and movement within the image.
Juxtaposition: Combine contrasting elements, such as old and new, big and small, or natural and artificial, to create visual tension and interest.
Text and typography: Integrate text or typography as a design element, incorporating motivational quotes, slogans, or phrases that resonate with the viewer. 

+ Train ChatGPT with labels
> [!tldr] Prompt
> Great. Now let's call this list the "Image Hook List". I will remind you to bring in Image Hooks if you forget. Whenever I say "add Image Hooks" you are to write the prompt taking into account the list above. Do. you understand?

*Yes, I understand. When you mention "add Image Hooks," I will create prompts taking into account the Image Hook List provided above, focusing on attention-grabbing and unusual elements. If you have any other specific requirements or preferences, feel free to mention them, and I will incorporate them into the prompts accordingly. *

+ Customize to brand
> [!tldr] Prompt
> Now I want you to add our company brand elements to every photo. Our company ls in the business of XXXXXXX. Here are elements of our brand to add to every photo.
> 1. Symbol of umbrellas
> 2. Confident, smiling faces. Never sad.
> 3. Green hues. Use color code #003000: A subtle trace of this color in each pic.
> 4. The subtle element of wings like on a bird, butterfly or plane or even wing design.

# How does that transform your business
## Generating content at scale
+ 70% of a copywriters time disappears
+ Cut time to generate an article from 8 hrs to 5hrs

### Step 1 - Feed transcript to ChatGPT
Feed with content that you own:
+ from an interview
+ from a podcast
+ from your recorded thoughts

> [!tldr] Prompt
> I'm writing a long SEO blog article about "*primary keyword*."
This is an article to *a list of what will be in the article based on the structure in the content brief*. The main insights and learnings will come from *Mindvalley trainer*.
You will be receiving a transcription of a *podcast interview/lesson/etc.* in chunks. Your task is to wait for all the chunks and then follow further instructions.
Wait for me to start. 

### Step 2 - Create the Article
> [!tldr] Prompt
> The article should follow this structure:
> - Introduction
> - Adam Vibe Gunton's Story
> - X Ways to Fight Addiction, According to Adam Vibe Gunton
> - Conclusion
> 
> Based on the six chunks and structure I gave you can you create a content brief based on the structure I've given you? 

### Step 3 - Titles and Descriptions
> [!tldr] Prompt
> Great. Now, let's start with meta-titles
Can you list meta-title suggestions that are engaging and pique interest? It must have the exact keyword "stones of overcoming addiction." Maximum of 50 characters. 

> [!tldr] Follow up prompt
> I like "Defeating Demons: Stories of Overcoming Addiction with Adam Gunton."
With this title and the information I gave you for the content brief, can you come up with a list of suggested meta descriptions?
It must be two sentences with a maximum of 155 characters total. It must have the keyword "stories of overcoming addiction." And it must provide a benefit so that the reader will know what they'll get out of the article by reading it. 

It is important to use your own data and content!

> [!tldr] Follow up prompt
> Great. This is the meta description I'm choosing to go with:
"*insert meta description you're going with.*" 

### Step 4  - Create a description
> [!tldr] Prompt
> Now, on to the introduction. Here's the structure you suggested:
-Start with an attention-grabbing hook that highlights the significance of the topic.
-Briefly introduce Eric Edmeades and his approach to hesith and wellness.
-Preview the main points you'll cover in the article.
Make it engaging, humorous, and lighthearted. I do like how Caitlin Moran writes-but in a toned down version and in an American tone of voice. 

### Step 5  - Humanize
Use a simple checker, that checks for AI written text. Make sure it has a human tone.
LLM as word prediction engine.
+ AI Checker [https://aiwritingcheck.org/](https://aiwritingcheck.org/)
+ [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/)

Check for the score.

### Consider for writing a book
