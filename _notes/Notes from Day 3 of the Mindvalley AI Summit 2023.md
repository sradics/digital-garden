### Hiearchy of effects model
*Robert J. Lavidge and Gary A. Steiner in the 1960*
1. **Cognitive Stage (Awareness/ Knowledge)**: This is the stage where the customer becomes aware of the product or service and gains an understanding of what it is and what it can do. This stage is all about providing information and educating the potential customer.
    
2. **Affective Stage (Liking/ Preference/ Conviction)**: In this stage, the customer develops positive feelings or emotions towards the product or service. They start to like it, prefer it over other alternatives, and gain a strong belief or conviction that this product or service is the right one for them.
    
3. **Behavioral Stage (Purchase)**: Finally, the customer makes the decision to purchase and act on their preference and conviction.

### Training GPT
> [!quote] Prompt
> What are the components of a brand voice that need to be defined to clearly describe the voice a brand speaks through. 

1. Brand Persona: This is the character that your brand embodies. If your brand were a person, what kind of person would it be? Is it serious and professional, or casual and fun? This component often includes aspects such as gender, age, social status, and personality traits.
2. Tone: This refers to the general attitude or feel of your brand's voice. Is it formal or informal? Humorous or serious? Inspiring or practical? This component is about the general mood that your voice conveys
3. Language: This encompasses the kind of words and phrases your brand uses. Does it use jargon or technical terms, or does it aim to be simple and accessible? Does it use slang or colloquial language?
4. Purpose: This is about what your brand's voice aims to achieve. Is it to inform, to entertain, to inspire, to persuade, or something else? Knowing the purpose of your voice can guide the way you communicato.
5. Rhythm and Pace: Does your brand speak in short, choppy sentences or longer, more complex ones? Is the pace fast and energetic, or slower and more measured? This can also include the use of punctuation, like exclamation marks for excitement, or ellipses for suspense,
6. Values: Your brand voice should align with and express your brand values. If one of your values is transparency, for instance, then your voice should be clear and straightforward. If one of your values is innovation, your voice could be forward-thinking and filled with enthusiasm for the future.
7. Consistency: This isn't a component of brand voice itself, but it's important that whatever voice you decide on, you keep it consistent across all platforms and types of content. This helps to build a recognizable brand identity

> [!note] Output
> Certainly, here's a template for defining your brand voice:
"[Brand name] communicates like your [relationship description] who's always [behavior]. Using a [tone of voice], they [primary action or goal] without making you feel [negative sentiment]. They [method or strategy), using [specific elements or themes] to make the information more relatable. The rhythm and pace of their communication are [description of pace and rhythm], like [metaphor or simile]. They are consistent in their approach, whether it's a [type of communication 1], [type of communication 2], or a [type of communication 3], always reminding you of their core values: [core value 1], [core value 2], and [core value 3). Living and breathing their dedication to [dedication focus], the authentic passion of [brand name] shines through every word they speak, aiming to [aim 1], [aim 2], and [aim 3] everyone to embrace a more [desired outcome]."

Certainty Domenic After carefully analyzing your top performing Reels and taking into account your brand insights, here's a structured formula template that can serve as a guide for creating future content with viral potential
1. The Hook (5-7 seconds): Start with a captivating or thought-provoking question or statement related to your content. It should stir curiosity create a sense of intrigue, or instantly resonate with the viewer's interests
Example: "If you had a Disney version of yourself, would it make content creation eser or at least more fun?
2. The Introduction (5-10 seconds): Briefly explain the topic or damonstration that will follow. This part should create anticipation for the rest of the content.
Example: "Today, I show you how you can create your very own Al-powered Disney character."
3. The Value Proposition (10-15 seconds): Highlight the benefits or interesting aspects of the concept/tool you're discussing Show them why they should care or how this can impact them.
Example: "Not only is this fun, but it can also help you create eye-catching content that stands out."
4. The Demonstration (15-30 seconds). This is the meat of your Reel-the step-by-step guide or tutorial part. It should be straightforward easy-to-follow, and visually engaging. Use simple language and break complex processes down into bite-sized steps
â€¢ Example: Tstep-by-step on how to use the Al too!!"
5. The Reveal or Result (10-15 seconds). Show the end result of the process, tool, or concept
you've been discussing. This is the wow moment that reinforces the value you're delivering.
Example: "And voila! Here's your Disney self, ready to star in your next piece of content."
& The Call-To-Action (5-10 seconds): Encourage engagement by asking viewers to comment, share, or follow for more content. Make this part direct, genuine, and friendly
Example: "Give it a try and share your Disney characters with me! Don't forget to follow for more tech hacks."
7. The Sign-off (5 seconds). End on a warm optimistic, or humorous note that leaves viewers with a positive impression of you and your brand.
Example: Tim Domenic, Mr. Grateful, until next time, stay curious and creative, my friends. Peace

Unfairness, Fear, Frustration
