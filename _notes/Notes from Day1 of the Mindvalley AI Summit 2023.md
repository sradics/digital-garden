> [!quote] Quote by Peter Diamandis
> There will be two kinds of companies at the en of this decade: those that are fully utilizing AI and those that are out of business. *Peter Diamandis* 

## Idea

+ Story to Midjourney picture
+ Generated Voice 

## How to write books in your voice?

+ Don't need to worry about a sucky writer.
+ Speed up book writing time
+ The Code of an extraordinary mind

### Step 1 Analyze text

> [!quote] Prompt
> Analyze the text below for the overall writing style. Take note of things like my style, voice, sense of humor, language, tone of voice and literary style. Using natural language, I then want you to create a prompt to write a new article in the same writing style. Let me know when you're ready for the text.

The Tool [ChatGPT Chunker](https://conturata.com/ai/chunker) Â divides a large input text into smaller chunks based on the specified token amount, and prompts ChatGPT accordingly.

### Create a reusabe prompt

> [!quote] Prompt
> Now give me a reusable prompt to allow me to convert any text into this specific writing style.

Output:
Instructions: Write a conversational and engaging article about *topic*. Use a personal voice, share anecdotes and experiences to make the content relatable and easy to understand. Add a sense of humor, using light-hearted language and references. Maintain a friendly and encouraging tone of voice, aiming to guide the reader towards self-improvement and personal growth. Use clear and concise language, employing analogies and metaphors to better explain concepts. Combine expository and narrative literary styles, weaving personal stories and experiences throughout the text.

- [ ] ðŸ’¡ Use my essay and analyse that regarding my writing style

+ You have to know prompt engineering!
+ You need to be in the top 1 percent of the AI people
+ Mindvalley - the most transformative platform on the planet
+ If you don't keep up to this game, you will be super fast outperformed
+ AI is gonna be part of our humanity (like books became part of it)
+ get your kids on AI
+ how fast can you enter the AI game
	+ 10 minutes ... to already make a huge mark on your business
+ It is how you solve problems. It is a mindset shift

Great facilitation prompt: **Just take 60'' to write down at least one takeaway from this session** 

## Using linked data

Who can code?
Who can write logic in Excel sheets?

2 requirements
+ Build linking data (with Airtable)
+ add to your identity that you can program

enables complete automations with NoCode applications.

Push it to one database and establish a single source of truth. Everything gets connected. The inner creator gets unleashed.

Why linked data for AI?

+ Learn first ChatGPT and MidJourney.
+ Integrate AI into existing workflows and transform them
+ Implement AI at scale

Steps

### Standardize

+ Will I use that process again? Yes .. standardize (at least document it)
	+ define the data needed
+ Define what AI tools you will use

### Document

+ the output you get from Airtable or elsewhere (direction of Second Brain)

### Iterate and Improve

Airtable to AI linking to e.g. create copy variations. Just via API connection between Airtable and ChatGPT. Connected with AdSale to automatically create ads.

Airtable integrates AI directly with the database (... need to learn more about Notion and AI).

### a few things to master

+ Build Database Structure (Tables & Views)
	+ Idea: need to get our pathways in database descriptions

## Talk from Jasmine Taillon

### Potential Legal Issues

+ Copyright Infringement
+ Trademark Infringement
+ Defamation
+ Privacy and Data Protection
+ Ethical Implications

### Copyright issues

+ How much human contribution is needed in order to own the copyright?
+ Advice: **document what your human elements are**

#### Example Zarya of the Dawn - How much human contribution is needed

+ Copyright registration was granted using Midjourney.
+ Copyright Office registered both the entire work and individual images contained.
+ Copyright Office has the authority to cancel a registration after giving 30 days to defend a registration.
+ Applicant was unable to show sufficient human authorship and the protection of the images was revoked.

### US Copyright positioning

> [!quote]
> ...when an AI technology determines the expressive elements of its output, the generated material is not the product of human authorship. 

> [!quote]
> ..applicants have a duty to disclose the inclusion of AI generated content in a work submitted for registration and provide a brief explanation of the human author's contributions to the work. 

### AI and Privacy

Privacy issues:
+ GDPR, state private laws, industry specific laws
+ what are you inputting and what are you outputting

#### INPUT CONCERNS

- What are you inputting?
- Is there consent or another justification?
- Can the personal information be used in a way consistent with privacy rights?

#### OUTPUT CONCERNS

- Is AI being used in a way that raises privacy concerns?
- Is it being used to make decisions that impact privacy?
- Do people understand how the technology is used and how it might impact them?

### Ethical implications

We have to account for the biases. Information might be biased by:
+ human bias
+ data bias
+ algorithm bias

### Tips and Solutions

- Consider confidentiality and privacy
- Consider protectability of the outputs (human authorship still required)
- Beware that output may infringe
- Check accuracy of outputs
- Make outputs your own
- Always have at least one substantial human inventor
- Realize there is no current ruling on mixed inventorship. Document the
- human inventor side!

## Presentation Iman Oubou

> [!important]
> For the right people to have access to it and use it properly. It needs many people with good intentions to overpower the ones with bad intentions.

Nice teaser question: **How are you feeling about this AI stuff**

Mindset for working with AI: Be curious, be creative, ask the right questions.

> [!quote]
> **If data is the new Oil, AI is the New electricity**

> [!quote] THE $6 TRILLION OPPORTUNITY
> Artificial intelligence is having a breakthrough moment and will revolutionize everything from online search to commerce and content, unlocking $6 trillion in tech investment potential, according to Morgan Stanley.

### Estimated AI value creation

For instance, PwC had projected that AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, which is more than the current output of China and India combined. Of this, $6.6 trillion was expected to come from increased productivity and $9.1 trillion is likely to come from consumption-side effects.

Additionally, according to the McKinsey Global Institute, AI could potentially deliver additional global economic activity of around $13 trillion by 2030, which would be about 16 percent higher cumulative GDP compared to today.

### Artificial Narrow Intelligence and General Intelligence - ANI vs AGI

+ **ANI (artificial narrow intelligence)** - smart speakers, chatbots, Image recognition, web search
+ **AGI (artificial general intelligence)** - do anything a human can do. AGI still a long way off (decades).

#### ANI

+ focused on a specific, singular or limited task
+ Examples Include image recognition, hyper- personalization, chatbots, predictive text
+ Trained on specific tales by data scientist
+ no self-awareness, consciousness, ability to think

#### AGI

+ not fully realized, with some developers questioning if it will be possible
+ machines that can handle a range of cognitive tasks with little oversight
+ The ability to learn, generalize, apply knowledge and plan for the future
+ Must consistently pass the Turing Test
+ General intelligence that possesses common sense and creativity and expresses emotions

### The AI Doomer

![[Pasted image 20230714164602.png]]

### Short Term Concerns

> [!attention] AI systems should be designed responsibly and transparently
> in order to **protect user privacy**, **prevent misuse**, and **ensure equitable distribution of AI's benefits** 

Need to expect a **tremendous shift in the job market**.

### Prepare yourself

+ What kind of **new skills do we need**?
+ **How should we be organized**?
+ **How do we start defining new jobs**?
+ How **can we bring our people along with us**?

### Understanding Generative AI

### 5 Steps

#### 1 - Define your goals and challenges

Clearly define your goals and identify the challenges you face in your internal business operations

*Example*
Goal: Improve customer satisfaction/client support
Challenge: Manual processing of a high volume of customer inquiries, leading to delays and inefficiencies

#### 2 - Assess your data capabilities

Understand if you have the necessary data to drive AI solutions. Find the gap to address.

Access what you have data on (eg):
+ Customer Purchase History
+ Inventory Levels
+ Customer Feedback

Access what you lack data on:
+ Real-time customer sentiment

#### 3 - Identify AI use cases

Identify specific use cases where AI can bring value to your business operations

For example:
+ Using natural language processing
+ Automate customer support Inquiries by developing a chat bot
+ Reduce response times and free up your customer support team

#### 4 - Find AI tools or develop AI solutions

Once you have identified the use cases, it may even be time to develop your own AI solutions. 

For example:
+ Partner With an AI vendor or build an in- house team to develop the chatbot
+ Train the chatbot on historical customer interactions

#### 5 - Implement and Monitor

Implement the AI solutions and closely monitor their performance.

### Prompt engineering - How to structure prompts

- Specify the scenario
- Assign a role in the instruction
- Provide the model with additional information
- Use specific formulations
- Formulate the instructions clearly

Understand that the previous conversation forms context:
+ either start new chat or
+ prompt: ignore all previous instructions
