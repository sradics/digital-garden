# Notes from Education that works by Danny Iny

[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg343GaD-hU)
The emporor is naked ... analogy for the current failing learning system.

It needs the call out, the public awakening. 
+ I need to support the argument

Emperor - higher education. 

+ You are doing a huge mistake
+ You're throwing your life away

I'm opting in to something else (something better)

It is about the opportunity costs with the invested time for long for learning!

4-7 years of their life
high debt
3/4 are working in a field that they did not study

Something messed up about higher education

Education - enabling someone to do something that they were not able to do before. 

If you can dream it, you can do it
This gap is bridged by education ... close the gap between could and do it!

ðŸ“– Leveraged Learning

"The future is here, it is just not evenly distributed"

Student debt crisis

ðŸ“– Everybody lies

Education has not changed enough

Everything you learn gets outdated in 5..10 years

Change at speed

+ Resourceful
+ Take initiative
+ Get things done
+ Handle ambiquity well
+ Play well with others

Learn to ask better questions.

think like an explorer, being excited about they might find

self direction to opt in ...

deep learning, powerful rule

deliberate practice
gather - practice - feedback - improve

grid - idea

be more griddy

self directed education
