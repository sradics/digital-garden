# Notes from Good Strategy, bad Strategy and the Crux - Podcast with Lenny adn Rummelt

[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uWKEG0s9Kc)

**==Strategy is about how to overcome high stakes challenges==**
One needs to differentiate between Strategy and analytical tools for solving or analyzing problems. E.g 7 Powers framework or Wardley Maps are such tools for deriving a strategy, but they are not the strategy!

Instead on strategy one might call it Action Agenda
## The Kernel
### Diagnose the situation
   - What is going on?
   - Hypotheses of what is going on & how things are connected ... we have that problem, because ...
   - Use any of the strategy tools for that!
   - **==What is holding you back?==**
   
### Guiding Policy
   - What are we going to do about this problem?
   - How will we deal with the situation

### Coherent Action
   - Deal with the problem
   - Donâ€™t fight with other achievers

## BAD STRATEGY
   - Set of wished goals
   - List of the thing you wish to happen
   - Fluff, word salad
   - Incoherent actions
   - goals are not the strategy as they leave out important aspects

## Strategy hints
   - Every time you say yes to something, you risk to turn a nascent strategy into a bad strategy 
   - Need a source of power / advantage / efficiency â†’ focus that power on a target that you can affect
   - Focus vs. different interests 
   - 7 powers - find the advantage
	   - [[Notes from the 7 Powers - Strategy]]
   - **==Strategy needs to exploit an asymmetry==**
	   - Relationships
	   - Knowledge
	   - Unforeseen / Counterintuitive
   - How is my company different?
	   - Power of the user base ... network effect
	   - Size is what matters
   - You need to have a reason that makes sense â€“ derived from a source of power
   - A lot based on history and past experience

**==Most important tool: Think Again==**

   - ðŸ“– The Crux
	   - [[The Crux - Richard Rumelt]]
   - Ambitious -> for which can you begin to make progress?
   - Choose a deadline that:
     - is important but also
     - is achievable
   - **==The Crux is the hardest part of the problem==**
   - **==Look at a problem - figure out what makes it hard to solve - find a way to solve it.==**
   - Insights come from immersing into a problem!
   - How should you go about creating a strategy?
     - **==Senior executives have to do this!==**
     - And they usually already know enough to do this
   - Inertia through (connect to Wardley Maps and forms of inertia)
	   - Diversity of talent
	   - Fear of Action

## Strategy in a Start Up
   - You are making a bet
   - You need to be clear about that bet
   - **==You got to be willing to shift==**
   - Quick adaptations to changing conditions
   - Think â†’ How should it be?  
	   - (the ideal window examples)
	   - describe that state in full detail to spot areas to address
