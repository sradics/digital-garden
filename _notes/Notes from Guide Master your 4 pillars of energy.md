# Spirituality

==**What do I stand for and do I act accordingly?**==

## Create a life plan

A document about 15 pages long that outlines my detailed picture of my life. Including goals that I would like to achieve.

Three main questions to answer:
+ What will be my legacy?
+ What is most important to me?
+ How do I get where I want to be at the end, starting from where I am at the moment?

# Body and Fitness

We need the energy, not just the time to perform at our maximum. So we need to manage energy properly (and not just time).

[[Notes from The Power of Full Engagment]]

==Work less and take more breaks.==
*Comment:* Links nicely with working Remote.

==Maximize our physical energy.==
+ Depends on how we *eat, sleep and recover*
+ Sleep is optimal between 7..8 hours *comment: would be interesting to get the science background here*
+ Working out increases ability to handle complex decisions by 70..80%

==Pay attention towards my *focus* and avoid multitasking.==
+ good connection with [[MOC Building a 2nd brain]] to gain a much higher level of focus

	+ it matters what you do in the first hour
	+ focus on high brain activity and avoid getting distracted by Social media or low brain activity tasks.
	+ in the early morning it is easy to achieve a state of low as more Dopamin and Serotonin are released

## 20-20-20

Move - Reflect - Grow
*comment:* Reminds me of the productivity days by [Dr. Antoine Larchez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoinelarchez/)

### 20 minutes to move

+ get sweaty - it creates BDNF proteins (see [[S01 Personal/030-039 Areas/32 Zettelkasten/Matter/Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor- A Key Molecule for Memory in the Healthy and the Pathological Brain]]) that is connected with brain plasticity and forming new neural connections
+ sweating also reduced cortisol - the hormone of fear

### 20 minutes to reflect

+ deep peace
+ record these thoughts in my Daily Journal
+ *comment:* Try to do more journalling in the morning and e.g. have the Gratitude part embedded in that reflection time
+ doing meditation. That also reduces cortisol

### 20 minutes to grow

For learning and growing our mind.

# Emotional

[[The Seven Principles For Making Marriage Work - John Gottman]] ([Blinkist version](https://www.blinkist.com/de/app/books/the-seven-principles-for-making-marriage-work-en))
