# Notes from How not to Worry
Chapter 1: **Worrying, anxiety and stress are all part of a cycle that can affect your health.** [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/how-not-to-worry-en?chapter=1)
- The key to combating them is remembering this simple motto: **“Stop before you spiral.”**
- Worrying is part of a cycle, where the next stops are anxiety and stress
- Worrying is both a cause and effect of anxiety or stress
-  **Stress weakens your immune system** and leaves you more susceptible to illnesses, as well as decreasing your sex drive.
- **stress makes you stupid**, as you’re constantly reacting to a threatening world rather than acting rationally.
- you **lose the ability to simply enjoy the present moment**

Chapter 2: Whether it’s past experiences or a fear of the unknown, **confront the cause of your worries**. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/how-not-to-worry-en?chapter=2)
- One of the **main reasons people worry is their past**. 
	- Past experiences can often manifest themselves as hypersensitivity to potential danger. 
	-  **becoming aware of** the way events **trigger** memories of your past
-  **the fear of the unknown** – one of the most powerful causes of worry.
	- because it’s beyond your personal control
	- get to **know yourself better** and ask yourself why you’re worrying

Chapter 3: Your rational brain tries to reign in the worries stemming from your primitive and emotional brains. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/how-not-to-worry-en?chapter=3)
- The primitive brain is located deep within your subconscious and controls the “fight or flight” stress response
- the primitive and emotional brains just aren’t very good at telling the difference between real threats or threats with low impact
- **body overreacts to everyday events**
- The **rational brain**, by contrast, helps **keep worries in check**.
- **ask yourself what someone who was more rational would’ve done.**

Chapter 4: **Awareness is the first of three steps** that’ll allow you to start tackling your worries rationally. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/how-not-to-worry-en?chapter=4)
- Ask yourself **“Where is my worry coming from?”**

- three categories – situational, anticipatory or residual stress.
- **Situational stress is a form of anxiety related to what’s happening in the present.**
-  **anticipatory stress: This is the anxiety you feel when you’re thinking about the future**
- **Residual stress pertains to the past**. 
	- Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a good example
- calmly ask yourself **“Why do I feel this way?”**

Chapter 5: **Analyze your worries** in order to understand their root cause. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/how-not-to-worry-en?chapter=5)
- The next step is: analysis. 
- Historical worries are a form of anxiety that mirror your experiences in the past
- Hysterical worry is the exact opposite – it’s deeply irrational
- there’s **the helpful worry – a form of rational behavior. This kind of worry is caused by reflecting on a real problem,**
- ask what you can do about them.
- **historical worry,** your best bet is to **seek emotional support**
	- Letting your feelings out doesn’t just make you feel better, it also helps provide clarity about the source of the anxiety that’s been bugging you
- **contextualize your anxiety by looking at relevant statistics**, and interrupting your own thought process

Chapter 6: The **final step to tackling worry is taking action and focusing on outcomes you can influence**. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/how-not-to-worry-en?chapter=6)
- You’re actually much more influential than you give yourself credit for.
- Use a sliding scale of zero to ten – zero means you have no control whatsoever, while ten means you’re fully capable of determining the outcome.
- start ranking your worries. Focus your time and energy on solving the ones which rank highest

Chapter 7: Your **imagination is a powerful tool** that can both trigger and alleviate worrying. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/how-not-to-worry-en?chapter=7)
- imagine the crowd naked” trick that’s used to calm your nerves when giving a speech. 
-  ask yourself **how you can influence the outcome.**
- **pick a role model she could imagine herself as next time she gave a presentation.**
-  imagine four advisors you can ask for assistance in important areas like work, health and relationships.
- What, for example, would the Dalai Lama say about this particular quandary?

Chapter 8: **Change your personal worry triggers, stop trying to please others and learn to ask for help**. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/how-not-to-worry-en?chapter=8)
- You wouldn’t tolerate someone else constantly criticizing and undermining you, so why should you put up with it just because you’re the one doing it?
- **stop trying to please everyone** around you.
- **swallow your pride and ask for help and advice**

Chapter 9: Final summary [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/how-not-to-worry-en?chapter=9)
- There’s nothing like **==exercise as a remedy for anxiety==**. Getting your blood pumping improves your circulation and releases natural opiates called endorphins, leaving you feeling cooler, calmer and – most importantly ­– happier.
