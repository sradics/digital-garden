### Reflection - Cultivating self-awareness
Ask your alignment questions:
- What's the pebble in my shoe?
- Am I living the life I choose for myself? Does how I spend my time align with what I value?
- Did I love well?
- Am I utilizing my strengths?
- How can I foster curiosity and compassion?
- What if it were easy?
- What am I avoiding?

### Vision setting - Am I headed in the right direction
How to eliminate $100 Work:
- Are my domains and $10K questions still the right ones?
- Answer your North Star questions
- Future-casting over different intervals (1, 3, 5 years)
- Frequency: Quarterly

### Planning & Prioritization - Your Anchor
- The GTD-style Review
- Indispensable and holds the system together
- Enables lack of due dates
- Sets your DO dates
- Tend to Domains (and ImportantNot Urgent)
- Frequency: WEEKLY (without fail), 25 minutes max

#### Small checklist - Do the review under 25'
1. Assign 5 units of $10K work or "Thinking Time" using do dates
2. Repeat the process for $1,000 work
3. Review aged tasks and waiting on
4. Set next actions
5. If you could only work 2 hours each day, what would you do?
