# Notes from Living Forward
[[Living Forward - Michael Hyatt Daniel Harkavy]]

## Highlights

* how happy are you with the life you’re living? Are your relationships authentic and meaningful? Is your career going from strength to strength? Are you fit and healthy in body, mind, and spirit?
* act as a reference point you can use to make sure you don’t get carried off by the current
* Most of us spend a disturbingly large portion of our lives meeting other people’s expectations.
* Map it out hour by hour to include family time, social engagements, work, fitness, well-being, and religious services – all the events you need to participate in to make your Life Accounts flourish
* Reflect on who’s at your funeral, too, and how they feel. What memories will people share? Are those memories rich and loving? Or do they fall a little flat? How does that make you feel? Is there anything you wish people were saying, but aren’t?
* fully review your plan every year. Set aside a whole day to evaluate your progress. Reflect on what’s happened in the past year that might have changed your priorities, and work out what you want to achieve in the year ahead.
* Your Life Plan will help you identify your priorities, set goals, and create a strategy to actualize them
* Which accounts are abundant, which are growing, and which are at risk of bankruptcy?
* Creating a Life Plan means taking responsibility for your life
* Evaluate how your appointments relate to your Life Account priorities. Cancel anything that doesn’t directly support the vision you have for your life. Then, reschedule anything that isn’t essential so you can attend to your crucial appointments first.
* stand up against those external influences that lure you away from the life you want to live
* A Life Plan is a document, between 8 and 15 pages long, that you write, describing what your ultimate life looks like. This vision will help you identify your personal priorities and create an Action Plan to support each of them.
* write a statement that describes how each of your accounts would look if they were flourishing under your care. For instance, your statement for “Fitness” might be “I am strong, vibrant, and healthy.”
* ask yourself what people would say about your life if you were to die today.
* your legacy is the way you’ll be remembered by the communities you’ve been a part of
* using specific and emotive language. For instance, for your partner you might write, “I want Charlie to remember the laughter, tears, and quiet moments of tenderness we shared.”
* That’s why the second crucial question for your Life Plan is, What’s most important to me?
* choose five to twelve that matter to you the most.
* reflect on the health of all your accounts. Which are doing well, and which ones need your attention?
* To avoid detours that lead you away from your Life Plan, you must ask yourself the final Life Plan question: How will I get from where I am to the ending that I’ve imagined?
* Figuring out the best route to your destination starts with revisiting your Life Accounts. Look at each one, and write a statement defining what your primary responsibility for that account is.
* The third and final method for managing your schedule is to practice saying no to requests that don’t align with your priorities
* When you die, how will people remember you?
* help you proactively and intentionally make decisions that lead you in the direction you want to go
* create a list of Legacy Statements by identifying how you want the important groups of people in your life to remember you.
* you need to embed it into your consciousness so it doesn’t end up like that dust-covered, forgotten strategic plan. To do this, read your plan aloud every day for 90 days. This will really cement it in your mind and heart.
* Dedicate a full day within the next two weeks to writing your Life Plan.
* To create a life plan, you must start at the end. The first question you will have to ask yourself is, What will my legacy be?
* To implement your Life Plan, you must take responsibility for how you spend your time.
* Your Life Accounts are the various components that make up your life, from your hobbies to your most valued relationships. Typically, they fall under three headings: “Being,” which includes your intellect, spirituality, and physicality; “Relating” – or the relationships and communities you participate in; and “Doing,” which covers work, finances, hobbies, and pursuits.
* To take control of your life, you need a Life Plan.
