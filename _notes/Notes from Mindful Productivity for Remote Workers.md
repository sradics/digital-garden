# Notes from Mindful Productivity for Remote Workers

## How to stay connected?

+ make connection and explicit objective for meetings. Include an element of connection in a meeting e.g. a check in, a get to know each other exercise
+ remember you can say/write just a hi
	+ How's your week/etc going?
+ async more, to sync less (but better) - save meeting time for when you really need it
+ make the most of not having a commute ... plan that time actively
+ take meaningful breaks
	+ catch up in a walk
	+ drink a tea/coffee away from your computer
	+ meet someone face-2-face

## Embrace flexibility

+ where you work (home, coworking space, office)
+ when you work (linear vs. non-linear)
	+ linear 9..6
+ when getting together - focus on building relationsships
+ What would you like to do with your saved commute time?
+ Can you work in different places and at different times .. that suit your energy, mood and what you need to do?
+ What would you like to do during the day that you couldn't do usually?
