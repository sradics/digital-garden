# Notes from Natalie Lue - It's not in your head, it is Gaslighting

## Notes from Natalie Lue - It's not in your head, it is Gaslighting

+ I knew it but I doubt myself
+ be aware of manipulations
+ gaslighters - make you believe their narrative
+ when somebody messes with your head
	+ creating confusion
	+ distort your reality
	+ misinformation, manipulation
	+ when the benefit from your distortion
	+ bring you under their control
	+ they shift the focus on you being the problem (to hide their behavior)
	+ sometimes form of a slow fade
		+ distance themselfes and leave themself out
+ example:
	+ a person denying that they did something although your clearly saw it
	+ a boss/coworker changing something in a piece of work and then denying they did it
	+ people making up stuff
+ get into the habit of sticking to facts
	+ you said, you did, I observed ...
+ ask for input from others
