# Notes from Playing to Win

[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7SN4FK8noY)

+ Strategy is intimdating as you need to make choices (and say NO)
+ Intellectual challenging
+ research based view of the world
+ Strategy is an integrated set of choices that compels desired outcome action.
+ Compel as a difference to force

## Five questions
+ What is your winning aspirations? What are your trying to accomplish?
+ Where will you play?  (What is your battlefield)
	+ where do customers get a benefit
	+ what customers are we talking
	+ what distribution channel
	+ finished product or component to be integrated
	+ 
+ How will you win?
	+ How can you solve that problem on a much lower cost?
	+ How will you be better
	+ For cost leadership you need to have enough scale
	+ Differentiation is often easier
	+ 
+ How can you be better than your customers? 
+ What capabilities do you need to have that enables you?
	+ Is there a learning curve?
+ What enabling management systems do you need to have in place.
	+ to build and maintain the moat
+ The ultimate way to compete to win is to never actually be forced to compete
+ Don't try to hold back the tide
	+  Water finds a way to flow
+ What is the single most painful gap that I'm currently facing?
+ Great strategists have one thing in common -- they practice doing strategy again and agin

Playing to Win (instead of just playing to play)

Either via lowest cost option ... or  .. by a real differentiator.

Understand customers as best as possible. And can you deliver that in a different way?  

Good reference to Helmer and the 7 Powers 
[[Notes from the 7 Powers - Strategy]]
- as a good categorization of the factors for building a competitive moat


Important - Customer need to lack something that we can provide
- compelling customer action
