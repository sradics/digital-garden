### Identify the prospect's current beliefs
Understand what your potential customers already believe about their problems, solutions, and your industry.

- Method 1: Listen for the (Bad) Questions Your Customer Asks
	- What do they really want? 
	- What questions do they ask that arenâ€™t the best questions for achieving that goal? 
	- How can you redirect them and show them a better path?
- Method 2: Ask Them Questions
	- Create a comfortable space for customers to share openly.
	- Use "what" and "how" questions instead of "why" questions to avoid judgment and encourage open dialogue.
	- Ask open-ended questions that encourage customers to elaborate on their experiences and beliefs.
	- Focus on understanding the customer's goals, motivations, and decision-making processes.
	- What led you to purchase X product or hire X service provider?
	- Think about the last time this problem occurred. How did you deal with it?
	- What makes it important for you to succeed with X?
- Method 3: Peek into the Cycles of Your Prospectâ€™s Life - rituals, routines, or patterns
	- Can you walk me through what happened when ...

### Identify the beliefs required for them to make a purchase
Determine the specific beliefs that would make your product or service the obvious choice for your target audience.

### Create marketing content that builds those required beliefs

### Use the Customer Journey for Belief Building
Belief Building process with the customer journey, which typically consists of three stages: awareness, consideration, and decision.

#### Awareness Stage
Customers may not recognize they have a problem. Marketing should educate them about the problem and its consequences.

+ What do they need to believe about their **problem**?
+ What do they need to believe about the **prevalence** (Verbreitung/GrÃ¶ÃŸe) of their problem?
+ What do they need to believe about **what happens if the problem doesnâ€™t get solved**? (consequences)

#### Consideration Stage
Customers are aware of the problem and exploring solutions. Marketing should position the product as a viable and superior solution.
+ What do they need to believe about their **different options**?
+ What do they need to believe about **my option**?
+ What do they need to believe about the **risks associated with inaction**?

#### Decision Stage
Customers are ready to buy. Marketing should reinforce trust and address any remaining doubts.
- What do they need to believe **about me**?
- What do they need to believe about **my product**?
- What do they need to believe about what happens **after purchase**?

### Factors for the Level of Belief building needed
- Price of the product. The lower the price, the less Belief Building youâ€™ll need to do.
- Length of the sales cycle. It takes less time to sell a gallon of milk to a family than accounting software to the government.
- Complexity of the product. A coaching program is more complicated to use than eggs.
- How novel the product is. Henry Ford had to educate horse and buggy owners on his revolutionary Model T car. It took a lot of Belief Building, but it was worth it.

# Questions and Observations
## Difference Belief and Claim
What is the difference between a belief and a claim?

A **belief** is an underlying conviction or principle held by a potential customer. These beliefs can be about their problems, the solutions available, or the specific product or service being offered. Beliefs are deeply ingrained and influence a customer's decision-making process.

A **claim**, on the other hand, is a statement or assertion made by a marketer about their product or service.
In essence, beliefs are the underlying convictions held by customers, while claims are the explicit statements made by marketers to shape and influence those beliefs.

### Examples
- **Belief:** A potential customer might believe that they are disorganized and need a better system for managing information.
    
- **Claim:** The course creator could claim that their course will teach the customer how to organize their digital life and improve productivity.
***
- **Belief:** A client might believe that having only a will is insufficient for estate planning.
    
- **Claim:** An attorney could claim that a comprehensive estate plan, including trusts and other legal documents, is necessary to protect assets and ensure wishes are carried out.
