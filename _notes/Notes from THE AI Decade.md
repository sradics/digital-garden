# Notes from THE AI Decade

- Assistants - formatting, documentation
- Agents - for execution of flows, task management

their ratio is 10:1 - 10 assistants and 1 agent

- automated form for exchanging knowledge
- AI powered knowledge revolution
- 32d/year for finding information (in companies)
- most knowledge is still just in people heads

Topic of meeting summaries
- agent to scan all meeting notes and create an overall summary

Knowledge Coding
- standardize company knowledge and making that knowledge accessible
- it needs a core understanding of what data types and what data importance level
- they also call it a Second Brain

"Your process is my opportunity"

A knowledge base for AI adoption....

## Generation ChatGPT
![[Pasted image 20250402104244.png|400]]

- soon 1 Billion ChatGPT users

Creative writing benchmark - message: creativity is heavily increasing

![[Pasted image 20250402104353.png|400]]


Claud/ChatGPT turning point

Non-KI topics
- breaking rules
- understanding social context
- individual journeys
- ethical understanding

## Insights from Decaid Academy
When do transformation succeed/when do they fail?

- Companies start seeing AI-First as an important step

![[Pasted image 20250402111116.png|400]]
+ 68% - missing AI knowledge as main problem
+ not really a good AI implementation strategy

Produktivity increases 40+% in 6 months

### 3 phases of usage
![[Pasted image 20250402111315.png]]

#### Fundament

- first AI experiments
	- basic knowledge
	- understand what AI can do well/what not
	- understanding tools
	- formats
		- kick-off workshop
		- eLearning courses
		- update/info sessions
		- best-practice sharing
		- pilot-project and experiments

![[Pasted image 20250402111656.png|400]]

Strategy defined, first use cases, positive first impressions

#### Exploration
- starting point: missing common usage approach

Goal: 
- standardize
- first process integration
- taskforce/AI champions/AI embassadors
	- with mandate to take action
	- pushes the topic, shares, informs
- build first productive workflows
- show measurable efficiency gains

Skills:
+ Workflow-Design & process integration
+ advanced prompting
+ understanding automation and API-integration
+ custom assistants for specific tasks
+ QA becomes super important (e.g. to cover hallucinations)

Formats:
+ task-force
+ role-specific usage discussion
+ workflow workshops
+ case-study sessions
+ tech-deep-dives

Action:
+ task force (<10), cross-functional
+ tool-stack definition
	+ reduce spreading of tool-landscape
+ implement first workflows
+ implement AI-buddy-system

This phase is important for long term success

#### Scaling
Goal:
- integrate AI in relevant processes
- systematic employee trainings about AI-skills
- implement AI governance, ensure proper risk-mitigation
- productivity gains about 30-40% (in often less than 1 year)

Skills:
- AI process management
- Agent building
- system integration - with company 
- business transformation
- AI governance & compliance know-how

Format:
- scaling AI taskforce in all units
- innovation labs - AI exploration spaces
- cross-functional projects
- executive programs ... to upskill leadership roles in direction of AI&strategy
- advanced AI-tech workshops
- AI transformation conferences

Outcome: AI-first mentality, tool standardization, governance structures implemented

Important message - the GAP is increasing super fast

### Main hurdles
- expectation management ... it needs time to implement
- "no time"
- stuck in experimental phase with unstructured usage (often when a task-force is missing)
- missing top/middle management commitment -- needs anchoring in top goals

### Hints
+ develop an AI strategy
+ maintain the governance structure
+ team eduction
+ implement a supporting infrastructure
+ AI task-force and change team
+ define clear AI-related company-wide goals
+ experiment, experiment, experiment and welcome an iterative trial & error approach
+ use-cases are crucial

### Roles
- AI manager
- AI designer
- AI marketing manager
- AI copywriter
- AI project manager
- AI compliance manager
- AI developer
- AI generalist

## AI and Content - AI supported content workflows
- more efficient content creation
- connection between - human - systems

Problem - scattered tool landscape

![[Pasted image 20250402120554.png|400]]


Challenges:
- Inconsistent brand language
- Tracking AI trends and responding to them
- Far too much copy-and-paste
- Too many different tools
- Varying AI expertise within the team
- Careless mistakes
- Lack of systematic approach in dealing with AI
- Agency USPs cannot be represented by standard tools
- AI expert leaves the company
- Data privacy and data security
- Efficiency issues with step-by-step processes
- Employees use AI too rarely

Problem with use-case specific tools
- tough to integrate with other tools


Option - work with adjustable AI blocks
- workflows
- agents
- assistents

![[Pasted image 20250402121439.png|400]]

often workflows and agents are mixed/misunderstood concepts

workflows:
![[Pasted image 20250402121551.png]]

- defined starting point and output
- important for process automation



Agent:
![[Pasted image 20250402121703.png]]
- own planing & validation
- can often learn from an execution (to further optimize their approach)

### Usage examples for workflows, agents and assistants
#### KI Workflows
- Data Extraction
- Transcription
- Data Analytics
- Content Ideation

#### KI Agents
- Deep Research
- Software Development
- Helpdesk

#### KI Assistants
- Content Strategy
- Content Plan
- Copywriting
- Advisory

Zapier/Make

### Tool example with Make.com

(like Zapier, n8n.io)


[Agentur-Kit](https://bit.ly/agentur-kit)

Cool use case for a No-Code content tool ...

## AI compliance

## Compliance-Shortcut Analysis

### 1. Bestandsaufnahme (Stock-taking)
**What:**  
- Regardless of whether you currently use AI or not, you need **internal transparency**.

**Why:**  
- **Duty of care:** You must know whether and where AI is being utilized.


### 2. Interne Richtlinie (Internal Guidelines)
**What:**  
- If you use AI, you must monitor the risk levels of your AI systemsâ€”thus, you need an **internal AI policy/regulation**.

**Why:**  
- **Helps manage AI usage within the company** and enables timely recognition of regulatory requirements (e.g., EU AI Act, copyright).


### 3. Kommunikation (Communication)
**What:**  
- Targeted measures for **transparency**, external communication, and internal team awareness.

**Why:**  
- **Transparency requirement:** AI usage must be identifiable, and raising employee awareness is essential.


![[Pasted image 20250402131733.png]]

- internal high transparency on tools in use is crucial
	- run a simple query in your company
- problem
	- complex legal 
	- unclear resonsbilities/accountabilities
	- missing know how
