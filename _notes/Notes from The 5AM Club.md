* Your Heartset is your emotional life and well-being. It‚Äôs important because, even with a world-class Mindset, you can‚Äôt deliver intellectually if your emotional life is a mess
* Next, give your Healthset ‚Äì your physical health ‚Äì some attention. One of the key ways to get ahead in life is longevity.
* If you‚Äôre only working on your Mindset, you‚Äôre ignoring your Healthset, your Heartset, and your Soulset.
* time for reflection with a period of deep peace and solitude.

* The first step is to move ‚Äì to perform vigorous exercise for 20 minutes
	* Sweat generates the protein BDNF, or brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which repairs brain cells and accelerates the formation of new neural connections.
* Take a few minutes to meditate. Research shows that meditation helps lower cortisol, reducing your stress. It‚Äôs a proven way to stay calm, and the great performers of the world are always calm!
* you need to grow, so take 20 minutes to learn

## The importance of Sleep and good phases of Relaxation
* Research has shown that ==sleep is one of the key factors in predicting life expectancy==. **How you spend the last hour of your day is almost as important to peak performance as how you spend the first**.
* a key to top performance over time is to ==oscillate between periods of passionate, focused work at the highest levels and periods of time for deep refueling== through relaxation, recovery and fun.
* Growth happens not just in the performance phase, but also in the recovery phase
* Embracing sleep and the ‚Äútwin-cycle of elite performance‚Äù is essential to maximizing the potential of the 5 AM club.
* Spend the rest of the evening talking with loved ones, meditating, having a relaxing bath or reading and go to bed no later than 10:00 p.m. That way, you can truly maximize the value of your 5:00 a.m. time.
