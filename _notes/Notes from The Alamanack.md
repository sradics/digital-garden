# Notes from The Alamanack
[The Almanack of Naval Ravikant at Blinkist](https://www.blinkist.com/de/app/books/the-almanack-of-naval-ravikant-en-eric-jorgenson)
+ if you're unsure about a decision, then the answer is no
	+ trust your doubts
+ **==a good reputation is an invaluable asset==**
+ strongly **consider the effects of compounding** (interest, knowledge, reputation,...)
	+ compounding is about playing the long game
	+ links to [[Essay - The CODE to leverage the effect of compounding knowledge]]
+ when you compare yourself to others and envy their successes, you get caught in the relative mindset - a recipe for misery
	+ links with building confidence [[Course - Confidence for Women in Leadership]]
+ if you (secretly) despise wealth, it will elude you
+ **avoid playing the status game** ... on the long run you will become angry, combative and a resentful person dedicated to putting others down
+ **Money can give you freedom**, unless you love it for its own sake
	+ if you love money .. money constantly occupies your mind. It is all you think about and it frames every decision
	+ Cycle of dissatisfaction and paranoia
+ Avoid constantly upgrading to new levels of money
	+ Links to frugal living (e.g. [[Midjourney V6 prompts examples/030-039 Areas/32 Zettelkasten/Literature notes/Matter/To Retire 10 Years Early, Stop Buying These 10 Things|To Retire 10 Years Early, Stop Buying These 10 Things]])
+ Happiness is a choice to remain in the present moment
	+ Happiness is just one possible way of responding to a neutral world ... we can choose to be happy
+ The **==fewer desires==** you have, the greater your ability to accept the way things are right now
+ **The more you ==live in the present==, the happier you'll be**
	+ think of you children, immersed in the present moment
+ **==Discover what calms your mind down and building good habits are keys to happiness==**
+ Quieting the simian chatter that prevents us from being present
	+ Mediation
	+ Sports
	+ Journalling
+ Eckhart Tolle - The Power of Now
+ **==Cutting down on alcohol, caffeine, sugar==** ... is keeping the mood more stable
