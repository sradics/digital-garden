# Notes from The PARA Method book by Tiago
+ Never create an empty folder/tag/container before you really have something to put in it (p50, Create Additional folders as needed)
+ Work with an Inbox folder to don't waste time putting it inside PARA at the perfect place immediately but file them in a combined session (p 58 Create an Inbox)
+ Installed [Custom-Sort Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort) to sort my folders according to PARA without having to change my Johnny Decimal Numbering system
+ **projects end while areas continue indefinitely**
+ every project falls under an area of responsibility
+ *Areas* - things you are directly responsible for and *Resources* - things you are merely interested in
+ For resources ask *Is this useful*, rather than *Is this interesting*

## PARA with a team
### Questions that highlight that effective Knowledge Management boils down to
- Is it interesting and attention-grabbing? (Does it make people want to read it?)
- Is precise and clear? (Can people easily understand wha it's trying to say?)
- Is it empathetic? (Is it written to be understood from the reader's point of view?)
- Does it help people solve a problem? (Is it clearly useful and effective?)
- Does it inspire people to take action? (Does it make it eas for others to apply it?)

## 3 PARA core habits
+ Organize according to outcomes (action first)
+ Organize just in time 
+ Keep things informal

What matters now is the ability to elevate your perspective above the fray of the day-to-day noise, remain in a place of calm perspective, and from that place to orchestrate the people, tools, systems, and flows of information surging around you.
