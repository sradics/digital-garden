+ **people grave frequent attention**, they don't grave feedback

## 3 Fallacies with Feedback
### Fallacy Nr.1 - You own the truth about others
* assumption - she is blind, I'm not blind
* the feedback receiver rejects feedback
* especially true, when providing even ratings e.g. on behaviors
	* my scores are moving with me
	* idiosyncratic rater effect
	* it's more bouncing me back on me
* there is a fundamental flaw in my source of data. And adding more of data makes it even worse

> [!quote] Quote on idiosyncratic rater effect
> human beings are unreliable raters of other human beings. All the data show that when I rate you, over 60% of your rating is about me, and not you. Which is a big problem, because we are paying, promoting, training, and deploying you based on that rating â€” which doesnâ€™t reflect you. So ratings are a terrible performance measurement tool, because they claim to measure one thing but actually measure another.

### Fallacy Nr. 2 - Learning is information transfer
+ I just tell someone what is missing and they will pick it up. Like an empty vessel
+ Scholl is often about that approach on learning
### Fallacy Nr. 3 - Excellence can be defined in advance
+ skills and competency matrix are a problem
+ you can define average in advance and a minimum

## What should we do instead.
### You own your reaction - share it
+ I am a reliable reporter on what I feel and on what I intent to do
+ we are really good at reporting on our feelings
+ "I was lost when you said that"
+ This is really good data for a feedback receiver
+ Stay on your side of the river
### Learning is insight - help others discover it
+ Feeling on knowingness that happens inside our brain
+ Help discover those insights ... create occasions where a learner can discover insights
+ link to Montessouri
### Excellence is connected to the person - replay their moments of excellence
+ get a person back into a moment that worked (coaching)
+ source of greatness is their goodness
+ essay - underline couple of sentences that really work and expression your emotions with it
+ replay on what you already did super well
+ leads to replication and repetition of what works super well
## Way forward - Q&A notes
+ What are the performance outcomes? 
+ What is my way of contributing to that?
+ How to best collect data on feedback?
	+ you can count things -- e.g. lost work days
	+ what can you rate?
		+ you can't solve the idiosyncratic rater effect
		+ people can rate their own experience and feelings on the team
			+ Do I feel respects in the team?
			+ Do I know what is expected of me?
			+ Do feel that your manager is caring about you?
			+ Does someone encourage you to grow?
			+ bundle that and bring that back to the manager
	+ So the questions in performance reviews need to change!
+ As a manager share your reactions as raw material for the other to discover themselves
	+ they learn to know when they are their best selves
	+ give people self advocacy
	+ they can discover when they are at their best
	+ get increasingly specific in describing for yourself when and at what you are your best
+ feedback in remote environments
	+ most engaging state is hybrid
	+ remote and onsite are about 10 points lower
	+ people are grown ups! and they want to manage their times and at the same time people (often) love meeting with other people
	+ frequent check-ins - every week, that matters
		+ How did you feel about last week? 
		+ What are your plans for next week
		+ leads to higher level of engagement and resilience and lower levels of turnover
		+ in the frequency lies detail
+ frequency of interaction is what really matters. (Don't become a people lead if you don't like doing that)
+ change the vocabulary
	+ no one is rated by someone else
+ Cisco as an example that changes their feedback culture
+ Mindset of broadening and building
