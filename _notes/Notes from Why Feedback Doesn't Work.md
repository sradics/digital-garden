+ **people grave frequent attention**, they don't grave feedback

## 3 Fallacies with Feedback
### Fallacy Nr.1 - You own the truth about others
* assumption - she is blind, I'm not blind
* the feedback receiver rejects feedback
* especially true, when providing even ratings e.g. on behaviors
	* my scores are moving with me
	* idiosyncratic rater effect
	* it's more bouncing me back on me
* there is a fundamental flaw in my source of data. And adding more of data makes it even worse
### Fallacy Nr. 2 - Learning is information transfer
+ I just tell someone what is missing and they will pick it up. Like an empty vessel
+ Scholl is often about that approach on learning
### Fallacy Nr. 3 - Excellence can be defined in advance
+ skills and competency matrix are a problem
+ you can define average in advance and a minimum

## What should we do instead.
### You own your reaction - share it
+ I am a reliable reporter on what I feel and on what I intent to do
+ we are really good at reporting on our feelings
+ "I was lost when you said that"
+ This is really good data for a feedback receiver
+ Stay on your side of the river
### Learning is insight - help others discover it
+ Feeling on knowingness that happens inside our brain
+ Help discover those insights ... create occasions where a learner can discover insights

### Excellence is connected to the person - replay their moments of excellence
+ get a person back into a moment that worked (coaching)
+ source of greatness is their goodness
+ essay - underline couple of sentences that really work and expression your emotions with it
+ replay on what you already did super well
+ leads to replication and repetition of what works super well
## Way forward
+ What are the performance outcomes? 
+ What is my way of contributing to that?
