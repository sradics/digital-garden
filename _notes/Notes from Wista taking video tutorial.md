# Notes from Wista taking video tutorial


## Basic setup tips
+ camera in eye hight and about an arm length distance
	+ just above eye-line and slightly pointing down
+ light in front of you
+ standing position for video seems to be a good choice
	+ actually in the camera video it was suggested to take a seating position when you are not in a studio environment
	+ more personal and casual
+ get hyped and pump yourself up
+ cover lens with hands when you got a good take
+ check if I can start/stop the recording via stream deck...

## Preparing material
* just take some shorts with the Handy camera

## About backgrounds
* office background is more authentic
	* for testimonials
* remove any background clutter
* try to have consistent, ambient light
* paper background
	* muted tones
	* different colors
* create gradient with a light pointing to the middle of the paper

## Camera
+ a camera setup with an external monitor is great

## Editing tips

### L-Cuts
+ Hear video before audio - makes it a little bit snappier and timing & pacing gets easier
+ work with many layers
### Trim dead space
+ helps with overall pace
### Stabilisation
+ remove shakening hands
+ there are several settings in tools e.g. Adobe Warp Stabilizer
### Being critical
+ remove fluff
### Framing
+ rotate and scale when necessary
### Keyframes
+ starting and ending point of a smooth transition
### Time & Pacing
+ add beats and breathes in between
### Too much b-roll
+ remove unnecessary clips
### Audio levels
+ leave final audio tweaks to the end
+ listen on several devices
