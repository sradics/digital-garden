### Detailed notes

Introduction [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/work-rules-en?chapter=0)
- at Google somehow brings to mind the idea of **personal freedom**, or working at your best 
- Laszlo Bock, the head of People Operation

Chapter 1: The secret to Google‚Äôs culture is its mission, transparency and voice. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/work-rules-en?chapter=1)
- mission is simple and powerful: ‚Äúto organize the world‚Äôs information and make it universally accessible and useful.‚Äù
- **profound mission** because firstly, it **gives moral**, rather than commercial meaning
- Google‚Äôs successful culture is its **transparency**.
- CEO updates the whole company on the past week and carves out time afterward for a 30 minute Q&A session

Chapter 2: **Hire** the best people **by looking beyond their degrees** and **focusing on** the right kind of **training**. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/work-rules-en?chapter=2)
- exceptional employee: **hire the best** or train the average. As you may already have guessed, Google does the former.
- looking for candidates who showed **resilience** and the **ability to overcome obstacles.**
- hire someone who was better than you, and to seek out those who can make everyone around them more successful.

Chapter 3: **Let your people ‚Äì with the help of data ‚Äì run the show**. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/work-rules-en?chapter=3)
- do as Google does, liquidate status symbols and reduce bureaucratic hierarchy.
- there are only four levels in the hierarchy: individual contributor, manager, director and vice president.
- So how do you make the best decisions? **Use data, not managerial opinion**. That way decision-making is transparent and less biased. Thus, one of Google‚Äôs core principles is **==‚ÄúDon‚Äôt politick. Use data.‚Äù==**
- properly managed with data and open discussion, a power handover to employees is incredibly effective, resulting in the implementation of the best ideas

Chapter 4: Both your best and worst employees represent opportunities for your company ‚Äì seize them! [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/work-rules-en?chapter=4)
- They **place outstanding performers under the microscope** and help out those who need to make improvements.
- high **performance is dependent on context**
- studying other companies‚Äô best practices won‚Äôt help
- **study their best employees** using an internal research team, PiLab or People and Innovation Lab.
- showed how **a great manager is critical for top engineer performance**
- below average performance is the result of lack of skill or motivation
- Google regularly identifies the bottom five percent of employees and offers them training, or tries to fit them into a more appropriate role within the company.

Chapter 5: Stop wasting resources on bad training, and **use the best teachers within your own company**. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/work-rules-en?chapter=5)
- the training is run by the wrong people, is sloppily designed, too general, or doesn‚Äôt get analyzed in a way that measures effectiveness.
- **Training should deliver specific information that people will retain**
- Anders Ericsson shows that the best way to master a skill is to **split the work into smaller tasks and aim for a specific improvement in one of these small tasks through repetition, feedback and correction.**
- the best way to **measure training** isn‚Äôt by time or money spent, but **through an improvement in behavior**.
-  trainer for sales representatives, it seeks out the best sales manager with the maximum amount of total sales and asks them to instruct lower performing sales representatives.
- it also creates a more close-knit community.

Chapter 6: Sometimes Google rewards failure and pays people unfairly. Why? [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/work-rules-en?chapter=6)
- Bill Gates reportedly said that **a fantastic coder is worth 10,000 times more than an average coder**.
- more effective ways to retain employees: **offer experience rather than money.**
- Their mistake was rewarding with money instead of experiences, like a dinner for two or a team trip to Hawaii. 

Chapter 7: Google confronts the dark side of its culture head on. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/work-rules-en?chapter=7)
- CEO Larry Page is responsible for the annual **spring clean where he discontinues some products that are waning**, don‚Äôt have great market prospects, or are being outperformed by others.
