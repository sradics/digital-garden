# Notes from joining the work transformation summit

@Jim Maholic
Clear direction of simplification of the IT tools stack in the company. This reliefs:
+ number of contracts
+ less efforts to maintain different tools
+ reduce complicated systems

Simplification and rationalization.

Where are we vulnerable to disruption?

Reduce the burden on operating and shift budget to innovation on all fronts.

The need to be even more communicative is important now that we face so many needs for change. 

+ Making sure information is distributed effectively and efficienlty

So proposals needs to hit at least one of these 4 areas to have a chance to succeed. (can use that also to strengthen argumentation for Fibery).
