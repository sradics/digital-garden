[Source](https://www.blinkist.com/en/app/books/the-bullseye-principle-en)

+ Align with what you say with who you are. And being in line with your personal brand.
	+ Take time to find 3 words that describe yourself. And then ask someone else to do the same about you
	+ What are my core competencies?
	+ What are my core values?
+ Write a two sentence personal brand statement for myself.
+ Set and example and define a common purpose ... makes teams up to 5 times more productive
+ If I'm fired up, others with do so too
+ Package information in a compelling story (connect with [[Storyworthy]])  (vs. boring stats)
	+ it simplifies complex situations
+ productive meetings - 4 questions (and create an agenda around that)
	+ What to achieve?
	+ Why is this important?
	+ Whom do you need on board?
	+ How much time will it take?
+ Always arrive early and well prepared!
+ Asking questions unlocks vital information!
	+ Converging questions - closed questions (Yes/No) - with one correct answers
	+ Diverging questions - open ended. And with many potential answers
	+ Rhetorical questions - statements that sounds like questions. Force others to connect to their stories
	+ Be specific with your questions. Ask short and precise.
