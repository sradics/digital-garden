***

### Power 1 - Scale Economics - size matters
+ **==The quality of declining unit costs with increased business size==**

#### Benefit
**Lowered Cost**

example Netflix: **Lowered content cost per subscriber** for originals.

#### Barrier
Prohibitive (unerschwinglich) Costs of share gains. 

(A competitor would have to offer better value e.g. a reduced price. This can then be captured by the leader they can match the price cut.)

#### Power Intensity
Industry economics: Scale economy intensity ‚ùì
Competitive position: Relative scale

#### Further sources
+ volume to area relationships (e.g Milktanks delivery vs. delivering in small cans)
+ distribution network density (eg. more customers per area so that delivery costs decline)
+ learning economies, where learning leads to a benefit (e.g. when you can learn more because you have higher financial freedom and can invest in more learning & experimenting)
+ purchasing economics - where a larger buyer can get better pricing

#### Dynamic view - What must you do to get there?
Simultaneously pursue a business model that promises scale economics and at the same timer offers an attractive product to pull in customers 

### Power 2 - Network economics - group value
One-hand-shakes-the-other-self-reinforcing upward spirals.
The value of the service/product to a customer is increased as new customers join the network and also use the product.

Examples: Facebook, LinkedIn - each users adds value to other users.

+ Rapidly scale or die
+ winner take all - once a single firm achieves a certain degree of leadership, other firms throw in the towel (example Facebook vs. Google+)
+ boundedness - the boundaries of the network effects determine the boundaries of the business (e.g. facebook private life, linkedin - professional network)
+ decisive early product - early relative scaling is critical in developing Power ... **==who scales the fastest  is often determined by who gets the product most right early on==**
+ also consider **demand side network effects**
	+ with important and exclusive complements for each offer, leader will attract further and better complements (e.g. the whole Influencer and Expert add ons in Instagram; or smartphone apps that build on existing apps and infrastructure)


#### Benefit
+ charge higher prices, because it provides higher value through the network (and the power of more users)
#### Barrier
+ unattractive cost of gaining share (what can be extremely high, when one needs to buy out users to join another network)

#### Power Intensity
Industry economics: Intensity of network effect (how important the network effect is relative to industry cost)
Competitive position: Absolute difference in installed base

#### Dynamic view - What must you do to get there?
In difference to scale economics: Installed base rather than sales share is the goal

### Power 3 - Counter Positioning
A newcomer adopts a new, superior business model which the incumbent does not mimic due to anticipated damage to their existing business.

+ an upstart with a superior business model, that is able to successfully challenge well-entrenched incumbents
+ steady accumulation of customers, while the incumbent remains paralyzed and unable to respond
+ Power only applies relative to the incumbent, but **says nothing regarding Power relative to other firms utilizing the new business model too**!
+ **==this power is not exclusive==**

Examples:
+ Kodak vs. digi-cams (although for Kodak did not face collateral damage to their film business by the digi-cams)
+ Nokia vs. Apple

#### Benefit
+ superior business model due to lower cost and/or ability to charge higher prices (link with Blue Ocean)
+ challenger should avoid trumpeting its superiority, instead adopting a tone of respect towards incumbent (so to not wake up a sleeping giant)

#### Barrier
+ inertia from incumbent, either being unaware or observing for too long
+ high expected damage for change expected from incumbent that leads to a "no" to change (e.g competing with an already established Franchise e.g. Zooplus vs. Fressnapf)

#### Reasons for Failure to Mimic
+ New superior approach (lower costs and/or improved features). Leading to new Products with high substitution power
+ Fast changed technology frontier 
+ aim to "Milk" a declining original business even though the new model is attractive
+ Uncertainty about the challengers approach
+ Bias from a currently successful business model
+ Job security

*Varieties of counter positioning*
![[Pasted image 20230601175904.png|400]]
*** 

#### CP versus disruptive technologies
+ core of CP is a new business model
+ disruptive tech does not tell us something about Power

+ kodak vs. digital photography - is disruptive tech nut not CP
+ In-N-Out vs. McDonals - is CP but not disruptive tech
+ Netflix streaming vs. HBO cable - is CP and disruptive tech

#### 5 stages of counter positioning
1) Denial
2) Ridicule
3) Fear
4) Anger
5) Capitulation

#### Power Intensity
Industry economics: New business model superiority + collateral damage to old
Competitive position: Binary: entrant - new model; incumbent-old model

#### Dynamic view - What must you do to get there?
Pionieer a new, superior business model that promises collateral damages for incumbents if mimicked.

### Power 4 - Switching Cost - addiction
The value loss expected by a customer that would be incurred from switching to an alternate supplier for additional purchase.

**==This power is not exclusive==** and can also be swept away by technology shifts

Switching Costs arise when a consumer values compatibility across multiple purchases from a specific firm over time. (repeated purchases of the same product or purchases of complementary goods).

#### Benefit 
+ charge higher prices - but only when selling follow-on products to the current customers

#### Barrier
+ sunk cost of learning a new system
+ competitors must compensate switching costs - so barrier arises from unattractive cost/benefit of share gains

##### Forms of switching costs
+ financial - transparently monetary from outside 
+ procedural - loss of familiarity with product and risk/uncertainty with new product
+ relational - loss of good connections to previous product people

#### Power Intensity
Industry economics: Magnitude of switching costs
Competitive position: Number of current customers

#### Dynamic view - What must you do to get there?
+ First attain a customer base

### Power 5 - Branding - feeling good
The durable attribution of higher value to an objectively identical offering that arises from historical information about the seller.

==**Not exclusive power**==

Branding is an asset that communicates information and evokes positive emotions in the customer, leading to an increased willingness to pay for the product.

+ pitfall lies in diminishing brand by releasing products that deviate from, or damage the brand image

#### Benefit 
+ charge higher price
	+ affective valences - good feelings about the offering, distinct from objective value of the good
	+ uncertainty reduction - peace of mind

#### Barrier
+ can only be created over a lengthy period of reinforcing actions (hysteresis)
+ copycat: long investment runway with no assurance to significant valence and risk of trademark infringement actions

#### Challenges
+ Counterfeiting
+ Changing customer preferences
+ Geographic boundaries
+ Narrowness 
+ Type of good - for high brand potential it needs 2 conditions
	+ magnitude 
		+ a promise that justifies the significant price premium
		+ high perceived costs of uncertainty relative to the cost of the good (e.g. when buying a diamond)
	+ duration ... it needs a long enough time to achieve such magnitude

#### Power Intensity
Industry economics: Time constant and potential magnitude of branding effect
Competitive position: duration of brand investing

#### Dynamic view - What must you do to get there?
+ Over an extensive period of time, make consistent creative choices which foster in the customers mind an affinity.

### Power 6 - Cornered resource - mine all mine
Preferential access a attractive terms to a coveted asset that can independently enhance value.

The services of a cohesive group of talented, battle-hardened veterans.

#### Benefit 
+ protected talent pool
+ preferential access to valuable patent
+ access to a required input (e.g. cement)
+ cost saving manufacturing approach

#### Barrier
+ personal choice (from a talent)
+ patent law
+ property rights

#### 5 tests of a cornered resource
+ idiosyncratic ‚ùì
+ non-arbitraged (not payed an extra price that eats the margin)
+ is it transferable
+ ongoing
+ sufficient for continued differential returns

#### Power Intensity
Industry economics: Price and/or costs increment due to cornered resource
Competitive position: Preferred access at a non-arbitraging price

#### Dynamic view - What must you do to get there?
Secure rights to a valuable resource on attractive terms.

### Power 7 - Process Power - step by step
Embedded company organization and activity sets which enable lower costs and/or superior product, and which can be matched only by and extended commitment

It is rare! as a power.

Example: Toyota Production System (that was build over centuries)

#### Benefit 
+ able to improve product attributes and /or lower costs as a result of process improvements

#### Barrier
+ difficult to replicate and can only be achieved of a long period of sustained evolutionary advance

#### Power Intensity
Industry economics: Time constant and potential magnitude of Process Power effect
Competitive position: Relative duration of process power advances.

#### Dynamic view - What must you do to get there?
+ Evolve a complex new process that offers significant advantages over a linger period of time

## 3 paths to compelling value - capabilities-led, customer-led, competitor-led
Compelling value requires that you mobilize your capabilities to offer up a product that fulfills a significant customer need currently unmet by competitive offerings.

### Capabilities Led
When a company tries to translate some capability into a product with compelling value.
Uncertainty: Is there a need?

### Customer Led
Many players spy an unmet need, but no one knows how to satisfy net. (eg. Fibric Optics back than)
Uncertainty: Can we invent it?

### Competitor Led
The inventor must produce something so much better that it elicits the gotta have response.
Uncertainty: Will new features be differentially attractive? Will existing competitor sufficiently delay their response?

## Seven perspectives on Power Dynamics
### Value Axiom
The main objective of Strategy is **==maximizing potential fundamental business value==**.

### Power 3S - Superior, Significant, Sustainable
* Superior - improves free cash flow
* Significant - cash flow improvement must be material
* Sustainable - improvement must be largely immune to competitive arbitrage

The referred terms benefit and barrier are a combination of 3S in this way:
+ Benefit = Superior + Significant
+ Barrier = Sustainable

### The fundamental equation of Strategy
$$
Value = M_0 \times g \times \overline{s} \times\overline{m} 

$$
+ Value - absolute fundamental shareholder value (equivalent to Net present value of expected future free cash flow)
+ M0 - current market size
+ g - discounted growth factor for the market
+ s - long term average market share
+ m - long term average differential margins (profit margin above that needed to return the cost of captial)
+ M x g reflect market scale over time.

### Mantra: A route to continuing Power in significant markets
This is a complete statement of the elements of a strategy.

### The 7 Powers
+ you need to have at least one of these for each competitor
+ What power types do I now have?
+ What power types do I need to worry about establishing now?

see [[#7 Powers in an overview]]

### "Me too" - won't do - It needs invention
If you want your business to create value, then action and creativity must come foremost.

***
$$
Value = Market Size \times Power
$$
***

**==The first cause of a strategy is invention==**
+ all 7 powers involve an invention
+ might be invention of product, business model, process or brand
+ Inventions lead to a benefit - features, price, reliability. Benefits lead to compelling value.
+ 3 paths to compelling value - capabilities-led, customer-led, competitor-led



***
*Invention at the center. Based on invention one can establish power and conquer market. Invention as gateway to power.* 
![[Pasted image 20230601124534.png|400]]

*** 

#### Resources
Start with the abilities you can bring to bear. Skills, tools, data, relationships, existing business.

#### External conditions
technological, competitive, legal

#### Invention
+ breakthrough products
+ engaging brands
+ innovative business models


### Power Progression

## Further notes
### Non Power examples
+ UI development - easy to copy a UI
+ Recommendation engine - with scale economics accuracy of recommendation increases, but not linear. A smaller competitor can realize most of the same benefit
+ it-infrastructure
