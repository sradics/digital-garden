# Notes from the Fifth Discipline
+ [Blink version of the book](https://www.blinkist.com/en/nc/reader/the-fifth-discipline-en)

If everyone is continually putting out fires, there's no time to analyse things.

## 1 - Promote Personal Mastery
Being committed to learning and growing. Leads to a deep sense of fulfillment and keeps motivated and excited.

Work motivates when it challenges to grow.
Connected with identifying our purpose and vision.

For leaders: Model this approach. Genuine curiosity is contagious.

Linking to [[The Big Five for Life]].

## 2 - Examine Mental Models
We're blinded by limiting (often unconscious) beliefs.

Made up of:
+ Judgements
+ Assumptions
+ Life experience

By identifying own mental models one can become more open-minded and learns how to question own thinking.

## 3 - Team Learning
Happens when employees enter a real dialogue with each other. With critique, probing questions and examination for own biases and assumptions.

Teams develop a combined intelligence.

Assumption Testing is a great way to enable team learning [[MOC Assumption Testing]] .

## 4  - Shared Vision
Gives energy to a learning organisation. Keeps people working and experimenting, also through disappointments and short-term failure.

Make it relevant to every employee.

Teams have a sense of ownership over what they do and how/what they contribute to the company.

## 5 - System Thinking
Systems thinking teaches you to analyse problems holistically. Cause and effect are often circular and influence each other in cyclical feedback loops [^1].

Understand underlying processes that are at play in organisations.

## Role of leaders
Combine the skills of being:
+ a designer - to design a learning environment
+ a teacher - to lead by examples and teach others
+ a steward - to protect and preserve things that are truly important
