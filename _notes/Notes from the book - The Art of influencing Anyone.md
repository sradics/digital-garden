# Notes from the book - The Art of influencing Anyone
Chapter 1: **Persuasion is** not about logical arguments but **about communication and appearance**. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/the-art-of-influencing-anyone-en?chapter=1)
- we put more faith in the things we want to hear.
- **the person who was more engaging and was enthusiastic about what the boss wanted to hear**
- speaker‚Äôs personality is in many ways more important than the content or rationale.
- First they look at the author‚Äôs name. Second, the quality of the content.

Chapter 2: Always **be warm and friendly and pretend you know what you are talking about**. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/the-art-of-influencing-anyone-en?chapter=2)
- lying poses a risk, if you want to do it persuasively, make sure you provide as much detail and information as possible.
- behave in a friendly and humorous manner, as this will help to conceal any gaps in your knowledge.
- share humorous anecdotes in his presentation

Chapter 3: **Influence others by simplifying and organizing information** so it‚Äôs easier to understand. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/the-art-of-influencing-anyone-en?chapter=3)
- **limit the customer‚Äôs choice to just two items** or services.
	- no one likes to be bombarded with too much information.
- we do like to compare a couple of options in order to decide whether we want to buy something or not.
- After showing the jackets with their pros and cons, come to a conclusion and show them which jacket you think would be ideal. This way the customer feels that you have weighed up options and come to a specific conclusion that suits her particular desires.
- **organize information into categories.**
	- Using categories like ‚Äúenvironmental advantages‚Äù (saves water, requires less energy) and ‚Äúefficiency‚Äù (faster than other machines, bigger so you can wash more clothes in one load)
	- help the customer make a decision

Chapter 4: **Talking vaguely** makes your **customers think you know more about them** than you do. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/the-art-of-influencing-anyone-en?chapter=4)
- **employ a technique called cold reading**
- **give the impression that you know a lot about them** and their needs and wants
-  cold reading technique is actually very simple. All **it takes is some vague sentences, which use a lot of statements that could be interpreted in many different ways.**
- The **first** thing you should **say** is **a general statement** so that your customer agrees with you from the start. This could be **‚ÄúDoing laundry is a real pain, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù**
- refer to a specific situation and your customer, by saying something like **‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you want to spend less time doing your laundry.‚Äù**
-  using this method will make you appear to really understand and empathize with your customer
- further **encourage this feeling** 
- **‚ÄúWorking in homeware, it is important for me to really understand what customers like you need.‚Äù**
- Speaking about things broadly is all you need.

Chapter 5: **Curiosity is the key to persuasion.** [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/the-art-of-influencing-anyone-en?chapter=5)
- **Catching attention is vital** because we are impatient and tend to lose interest quickly.
- **==only one in five people read further than the headline of an advertisement.==**
- if you can‚Äôt ignite curiosity within the first few minutes of talking with potential customers, they will most likely not buy your product.
- **begin your conversation with an interesting or surprising statement.**
	- start off saying something humorous, surprising or even controversial.

Chapter 6: **People** don‚Äôt **buy** what they need, but **what they want**. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/the-art-of-influencing-anyone-en?chapter=6)
- if you can **evoke desire for your product**, people will buy it regardless of whether they need it or not.
- focus on what they want instead.
- **give them ¬†reasons that provoke what they desire.**
- One way to spark their desire is to **alter their perspective.**
	- we subconsciously want our behavior to line up with our attitude (or self-perception). So if you change one, the other can also change.

Chapter 7: Influencing people depends on covering up your true intentions so you seem less desperate. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/the-art-of-influencing-anyone-en?chapter=7)
- **get your customers to sell for you**
	- which laptop you want to buy. Who would you trust more: a salesperson or a friend who‚Äôs used both computers?
- think of ways to **advertise products through the opinions of others**.
- **tell them a story about your product in a way that is not obvious to them** that you are plugging your own business.

Chapter 8: When trying to persuade someone, **don‚Äôt fight their resistance; utilize it**. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/the-art-of-influencing-anyone-en?chapter=8)
- surprise the people you're selling to by **embracing their resistance**
	- if you try really hard to convince somebody, he is likely to become defensive and will become even more sure about his own opinion.
- first thing you should do is **agree with your customer‚Äôs concerns**.
-  find a way to **overcome their negative thoughts** **by showing** why, even after all things considered, **your product is great**.

Chapter 9: Final summary [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/the-art-of-influencing-anyone-en?chapter=9)
- Be **surprising and controversial**.
- When you approach customers, start your conversation with a surprising, humorous or even controversial one-liner to pique their curiosity.
