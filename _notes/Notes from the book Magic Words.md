# Notes from the book Magic Words

Chapter 1: Magic words connect you with others by motivating them. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/magic-words-en?chapter=1)
- Magic words motivate others, and thus make you a more effective communicator. 
- words only constitute about seven percent of what we communicate – the rest is body language and tone of voice.

- magic words only work when they go hand in hand with a strong, positive human connection

Chapter 2: The **most important magic word is “yes”** and the word you should **avoid** the most is **“no.”** [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/magic-words-en?chapter=2)
- the word “yes” is ingrained in our psyche; we love hearing it. It’s the ultimate magic word.
- don’t say, “Please fix this for me.” Instead, **ask, “Can we fix this?” Because, if you can get someone to say yes, they’ll be more likely to actually do it.**
-  get the other person **to say yes two or three times before you get to the actual request**
- salespeople increased their success rate from 18 to 32 percent by inducing the people to say yes at least three times before coming to the sale
- When you mention something negative, the conversation moves away from positivity toward feelings of fear, caution and rejection.

Chapter 3: **Grab attention by using names** and direct attention by saying **“but.”** [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/magic-words-en?chapter=3)
-  if you want to grab someone’s attention and focus, say their name before you make your point. It’s that simple.
- People also feel more important and more highly valued when they hear their name 
- **But Eraser** - “But” has a very specific power. **When you say the word “but” you decrease the impact of the preceding phrase**
- **But Enhancer** - **emphasize** the **phrase that follows**
- So start out with the information you want the person to forget, then use a “but” and end with the information you want them to remember.

Chapter 4: **“Because” and “if” motivate people to act and think.** [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/magic-words-en?chapter=4)
- If you can **give them a reason, they’ll be more motivated to act.**
- “because” is the next magic word
- **encourages** them **to search for their own “because”** and, once they find it, they’ll be much more motivated to act on it.
- “**if,” induces people to think more hypothetically and creatively**
- it combats reverse psychology.
- **“If you don’t bet on them, think how you’ll feel when they win,”** 73 percent took their advice.
-  use **“if” to guide people’s thoughts** in a certain direction.
- If the person insists they can’t do something
- **“What would you do if you could?”**

Chapter 5: **“Help” is useful when delegating responsibility** and **“thanks” keeps motivation levels high**. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/magic-words-en?chapter=5)
- It makes you feel important and needed, doesn’t it? That’s what makes “help” such a powerful magic word
- “Thanks” is important in business: businesses need to thank their customers and bosses need to thank their employees. “Thanks” keeps customers happy and makes employees feel more valued and motivated.
- employees should feel accomplished and proud when they finish a project
- smiling more often

Chapter 6: Final summary [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/magic-words-en?chapter=6)
- **==elicit “yeses” and avoid “nos,” direct attention with “but,” motivate others with “because” and “if” and show appreciation with “help” and “thanks.”==**
