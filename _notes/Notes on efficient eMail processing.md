# Notes on efficient eMail processing
[https://youtu.be/uXdEVeoGRRc](https://youtu.be/uXdEVeoGRRc "Share link")

+ Organize that information can flow from your eMail downstream to
	+ Calendar
	+ Task manager 
	+ Digital Notes app
	+ Read later app to forward what to watch later
+ Unsubscribe from Newsletters and 
	+ subscribe to really important ones via Read-Later-App - I do this with Matter

## Make triage decisions in seconds
* Archive
+ Reply
+ Add to calendar
+ create task
+ store as reference (in Notes app) -- when I'm really familiar with the content
+ add to read-it-later app  ... just like my waiting room
