# Notes on the Crisis of Fractured Organizations
[Source](https://www.airtable.com/ty/resources/reports/crisis-of-the-fractured-organization)
## Claims
* make data widely accessible across the organization
* use low code tools to build connected apps (to improve productivity)
* strenghten alignments and employee engagement
* a policy of digitizing everything always
* create a data sharing strategy - data/information available in an organized, self-service and frictionless way
* democratize software development 

## The Problem
+ information locked within different teams and systems
	+ creates boundaries across teams
+ delayed and not-best informed decision making
+ risk of manual errors
+ huge time wasted in finding information
+ blind spots across the organizations
+ fractures are leading ==people to feel frustrated and disengaged==
+ especially leadership:
	+ don't have the full picture



### Data
+ large organizations (>20k employees) have on average 367! software apps/systems
+ 2.4h daily to look for data/information
+ 24% drop in productivity (19% in teams from inefficient and disconnected processes)
+ 8/10 decision-makers ... reducing data and information silos is a top priority
+ 90% with improved collaboration as top priority
+ 79% said that teams are siloed throughout the organization
+ top reason behind employee disengagement is ==data/information is hard to find==

## Change suggested
+ create shared datasets
+ work with Low-Code-tools leveraging these shared datasets
+ use customizable software that allows organizations to connect silos and work with more agility

## Upskilling
+ on usage of Low-Code tools
