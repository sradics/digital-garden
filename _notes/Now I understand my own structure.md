Now I understand my own structure

â†’ A next step to access deeper insights

I admit I'm blown away by Notebook LM and its recent added capabilities.

I gave it two of my sources:
â†’ My recent newsletter 
(âœ¿ The Death of Simple Productivity (What Replaces It))

â†’ And a backing research I asked Gemini for
(The Complexity Paradox: A Systems-Theoretic Approach to Managing Information and Achieving Clarity)

And among many other insights, it came up with the MindMap you see in the post's image.

It truly blew my mind.

This mindmap provides a visual entry point to the length written form.
It was completely created by Notebook LM AI. 
And it is interactive. You can tap on a node and it provides the insights from the sources and extends the information.

â€”â€”â€”

Here's what changed for me:
â†’ I see new connections - as I get the perspective from AI on my writings
â†’ I can easily access insights visually, via audio and even video ... 

This makes insights tangible and highly accessible. 

â€”â€”â€”

Give it a try in 3 easy steps ... you can do in 5 minutes
1) Create a new Notebook with Notebook LM and add a source
2) In the Studio ... Add a Mind Map
3) Have fun exploring

If you want a fast start - here's the Notebook that I created from the two articles I just mentioned: [https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/fe69c97e-cb99-4f81-974f-281bf6e11d3e?artifactId=e3688915-fe05-43e4-8bc5-e68ac34c0b20](Now I understand my own structure
