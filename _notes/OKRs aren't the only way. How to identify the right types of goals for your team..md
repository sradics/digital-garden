## Highlights
* there isn’t a one size fits all goal setting approach that works for all teams.
* Doing something new: Discovery and Zero-to-One type goals. 2. Building on the existing: Iterate and Scale type goals. 3. Business as usual: The day-to-day work that is often overlooked and not classified as goals, but requires your team's bandwidth.
* If you find that team goals aren’t aligning with the company mission it could be because nobody understands and/or buys into the mission.
