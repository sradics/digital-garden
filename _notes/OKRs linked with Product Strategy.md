# OKRs linked with Product Strategy

![[Pasted image 20221012122055.png]]

Interesting positioning here where OKRs are taken to phrase strategic goals and with that directly link with the product strategy.


OKRs are a methodology for strategic planning and organizational improvement, but they are not a tool for strategic thinking. They help us to activate or execute a strategy, but not to design it. [^1]
