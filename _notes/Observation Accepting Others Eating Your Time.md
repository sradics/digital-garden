# Observation Accepting Others Eating Your Time

Again I observed someone complaining about having a full calendar and being in meetings all day long. And I asked myself: ==Who is in the driving seat? Aren't we managing our own time?== ==And what prevents us from just rejecting an invite when it does not suit us?==

I think it is a mix of ==not being conscious about oneself== and ==own empowerment to decide how spent time==. In addition it is fear of missing out. And it is fear of being in charge to explain or even justify an invite rejection.
