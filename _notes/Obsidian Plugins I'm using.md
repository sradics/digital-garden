## Some plugins a little more detailed

**Advanced Slides**Â - let's me create presentation with templates directly in Obsidian. I can also present from their and can embed existing content. Really helpful to avoid copying.  
  
**Auto Note Mover**Â - helps to get rid of manual moving notes. I combine that with the templater plugin to maintain my Zettelkasten.  
  
**Book Search**Â - really cool plugin to immediately fetch book information and link a book directly in my journal and book kanban.  
  
**Copy Block Link**Â - allows me to directly link to a block in a note. This way I can jump directly to areas in a note  
  
**Excalidraw**Â - likely you know that already. This is really nice for creating sketches and link from there to notes. Really active development and recently also added further enhancements to work with Pdfs.  
  
**Focus Mode**Â - really nice to work on notes with deep focus. I have this also mapped to my Loupedeck  
  
**Frontmatter Tag Suggest**Â - just makes working with tags inside front matter much easier  
  
**Hotkeys for templates**Â - love this one as this simplifies creating new notes jsut with a hotkey. I have them for literature notes, permanent notes, fleeting notes.  
  
**Icon folder**Â - tiny but good. Allows me to add pictures to folders.  
  
**Kindle highlights**Â - my main plugin ... brings me all the highlights from Kindle directly to Obsidian  
  
**Linter**Â - beautiful to add meta information and keep notes in shape  
  
**Obsidian Git**Â - just recently switched to do a backup using Git. This makes it really seamless  
  
**Omnisearch**Â - helps a lot with finding items  
  
**Pomodoro**Â - nice little Pomodoro timer that helps me when I'm in focus mode  
  
**Recent Files**Â - really often to just reference the last used files. E.g. when writing my daily journal  
  
**Smart Connections**Â - what a super great AI plugin. Brings my notes and leveraging that with AI to the next level  
**Text Generator**Â is also good, but Smart Connections is more advanced as this also builds on topic of own knowledge.  
  
**Spaced Repetition**Â - great for learning. I used that when I really need to memorize something  

**Strange new world** - great for drilling down on a link immediately and finding further associations.
  
**Tidy footnotes**Â - great simplifier when you work with Footnotes  
  
**Typewriter scroll**Â - great to have focussed writing mode  
  

## Some combinations & usage information-

I use Smart Connections to ask for connection between my notes. Also to create a further summary of it.  
  
I use a combination of Templater, Auto Note Mover and Template Hotkey to create notes of a special type fast and place the note at the right place. In addition I'm using the external LoupeDeck to just press a button and have a new note created. This removes cognitive load when creating notes.
