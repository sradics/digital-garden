# [[Obsidian is my Second Brain software]]
## LinkedIn Post

I poured 20 years of my heart into my diary.

â†’ And then someone stole it
â†’ I imagine Iâ€™d feel utterly exposed
â†’ Can you imagine this happens to you
â†’ I never want this to happen to my notes

Yet, many 
keep private notes online.
lured by convenience, unprepared
for a Black Swan event to strike their data.

I PREPARED
â†³ I chose Obsidian for my note-taking and diary

âž  Where my Second Brain thrives with insights

â†’ My ideas in future-proof plain text files
â†’ I own and control my data

My three next arguments for
Obsidian as your Second Brain foundation

âž  You Own Your Notes
â†’ I avoid proprietary lock-ins
â†’ Notes are stored as plain text files
â†’ Easy to transfer to any other tool if required

âž  Make it a Custom Home for Your Notes
â†’ Personalize your digital space
â†’ Work with templates and your themes
â†’ Build on simple text but powerful to extend

âž  Improve your thinking
â†’ Link notes to foster deeper connections
â†’ Play with your ideas and get new insights
â†’ Develop your personal idea universe over time

As our notes will last for a lifetime. 
I recommend to build on a foundation,
that is as future-proof as possible and that
makes you feel save and comfortable to grow on.

Don't know where to start yet?
ðŸŒ± I'm here for you.
