On my way becoming a 4MAT learning types expert

The next 3 days will be full immersion into 4MAT and the 4 Learning Types. I'm looking forward to being trained by Hanne Houbak. I'm convinced that tailoring learning to really support our individual way of learning is crucial to Smarter Learning - learning with high motivation and engagement, more effectively and efficiently.

What I aim to learn:
+ Deeper insights on all 4 Learning Types
+ Impulses how to design more tailored workshops and trainings to support individual learning approaches
+ further clarity how to connect that with learning through a Second Brain
+ my own discovery for ways to amplify the 4 Learning Types with AI

As I'm on the way and will directly work with Hanne, the leading expert for 4MAT in Europe - maybe you have questions that I might ask her? Add all your questions in the comments and I'll try to find answers for you and reply later directly in the comments.
