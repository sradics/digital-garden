The 4-year-old who couldn't speak  
â†’ taught me this about learning  
  
I was born with a cleft lip, which made speaking clearly impossible as a child.  
At four, I couldnâ€™t pronounce basic words or letters.  
  
After surgery and months of speech therapy,  
I relearned how to speakâ€”an intense learning experience tied to my survival.  
  
Hereâ€™s what I realized:  
âž  Learning isnâ€™t just about intelligence â€”  
itâ€™s about persistence and the ability to adapt.  
  
That lesson has shaped my life ever since.  
  
Life is unpredictable.  
Obstaclesâ€”big and smallâ€”will happen.  
  
But hereâ€™s the key:  
â†’ Learning is your greatest survival tool.  
  
Learning is the investment that always pays off, helping you:  
â‡¢ master technology  
â‡¢ overcome challenges  
â‡¢ even recover from personal setbacks  
  
Yet most stop learning because they:  
â‡¢ Feel they donâ€™t have time.  
â‡¢ Doubt the return on investment (ROI).  
  
And I get you.  
  
When overwhelmed with tasks,  
we often forget to prepare our tools before tackling the work.  
  
What if we instead look at Abraham Lincoln's wisdom:  
'Give me six hours to chop down a tree,  
and I will spend the first four sharpening the ax.'?  
  
When we build on past bad experiences with learning that were:  
â‡¢Â forced  
â‡¢Â boring  
â‡¢Â low impact  
Why should we be excited to keep up on the learning path?  
  
Because it can be such a different experience.  
You can re-discover your curiosity.  
You can re-connect to the joy.  
  
I did. I now enjoy learning. I'm curious AGAIN.  
You can do that too.  
  
Need a helping hand? I'm rooting for you, my friend.  
I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease
