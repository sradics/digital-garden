He experiences often happiness boosts while exploring his thoughts and finding new solutions to questions from his pears.

His learnings are more connected and lead to a bigger picture. Sebastian also learned to take care of his knowledge. He understood, that his own insights will provide a foundation, that also make him independent from staying in this company forever. 

He wakes up excited every day, knowing he's making a significant impact. His team is highly engaged, and productivity has soared. Sebastian has implemented a "Second Brain" system, allowing him to effortlessly capture, organize, and retrieve information. This has made him the go-to person for innovative solutions in his company.

His learning compounds daily, just like smart investments. He's known for his ability to quickly adapt to new challenges and consistently bring fresh, well-informed perspectives to the table.

Sebastian reached a level of mind freedom that he never experienced before. He can think the thoughts, he can go deeper without feeling pressure or guilt. 

He experiences inner calm. His fear of losing everything stopped. 
He can dedicated his full energy on living his curiosity. On exploring interesting insight, on discovering new insights. 

It feels like his live taps into a higher meaning. Like he did not waste his time on earth. 

Sebastian's continuous learning approach has made him resilient to industry changes. He's always ahead of the curve, anticipating trends. His ability to quickly process and apply new information has made him an invaluable asset.

TODO: I need to explore this deep connection between learning & having a meaning. This seems to matter a lot to me.
