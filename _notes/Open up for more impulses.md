From Job Board to Life-Changing Platform:

â†’ My Decade-Long LinkedIn journey

There is one key lesson I learned about LinkedIn:

The importance to take a step back from my initial impression.
âž  To exploring beyond the surface.

I started over 10 years ago., 
viewing LinkedIn as merely a job platform.

It took me nine years to realize that it offers so much more.

Even though LinkedIn's features have evolved significantly over time,
I remained stuck in my old understanding.

Initially, I began writing on LinkedIn with the intention of promoting a service. 

Naively expecting that a simple shoutout would suffice.

I was mistaken, 
but this realization opened my eyes to LinkedIn's broader potential.

Today LinkedIn is a platform for me a place to: 
â†’ Learn about emerging topics and trends
â†’ Build a network with incredible people
â†’ Offer services and attract clients
â†’ Test ideas and get feedback
â†’ Develop lasting friendships

There's so much to gain once we remove our first impression blinders.

Wishing you an exploration-rich weekend!

What was one surprising LinkedIn feature 
you discovered later in your journey?
