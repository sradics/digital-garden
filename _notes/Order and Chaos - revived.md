# [[Order and Chaos - revived]]

Starting a business is overwhelming.

â†’ But does it have to be chaotic?

I am building my business.Â 
I am overwhelmed.Â 
I need clarity.

It is a huge learning journey. For example . . .

â†’ I conducted over 50 interviews to understand my clientâ€™s problems and find solutions.

â†’ I read six sales and marketing books since my layoff

â†’ I began networking in two entrepreneur groups to understand how building a business really works

One can easily end up in chaos, where youâ€™re starting many things, finishing nothing. Where youâ€™re consuming much, retaining little.

But once I remembered how learning works best . . .

â‡¢ I have a much better understanding of the problems people face

â‡¢ I can write better marketing landing pages and content

â‡¢ I formed a network with strong partners I can ask for help and rely on

The key to success in learning how to learn is to master these three pillars:

âž  The mindset of learning
    
âž  Creating high-impact outcomes
    
âž  Leverage modern tools and approaches for learning

You can learn more about these three pillars and how they can help you future-proof your career and stay at the cutting edge of learning. I'm opening registrations to my next virtual MASTERCLASSÂ called Effortless Learning, Lasting Results. 

Get on the waiting list.
