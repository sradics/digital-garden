## Highlights
an outcome is a change in human behavior that drives business results. — location: [49](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=49) ^ref-30482

---
Instead, outcomes are the changes in customer, user, employee behavior that lead to good things for your company, your organization, or whomever is the focus of your work. — location: [50](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=50) ^ref-53069

---
We could have done that by focusing on the outcomes that our customers—the traders—were seeking, — location: [53](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=53) ^ref-16494

---
we want to use a planning process that makes it possible to make as little stuff as possible and still achieve the outcome we seek. — location: [74](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=74) ^ref-65292

---
Outcomes, or the human behaviors that drive business results, are what happen when you deliver the right features. — location: [75](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=75) ^ref-32678

---
called the Program Logic Model — location: [83](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=83) ^ref-24904

---
Although our ultimate target is to improve the standard of living in the village, that target is actually a result of many factors. To see if our work is actually making a difference, we need checkpoints that are smaller, measurable, and more closely connected to the work that we’re doing. That’s where outcomes are important. — location: [91](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=91) ^ref-908

---
makes it hard is that we often set goals that are too high level—we — location: [95](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=95) ^ref-16882

---
We do this by asking them to focus on changing customer behavior in a way that drives business results. — location: [98](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=98) ^ref-27687

---
They’re all measures of customer behavior. — location: [100](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=100) ^ref-61088

---
to deliver the behavior change that we seek, — location: [102](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=102) ^ref-25110

---
and to make a meaningful contribution to the impacts (revenue, profitability) that our executive leaders care about. — location: [102](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=102) ^ref-18993

---
you can manage a team by telling them what to make: that’s called managing outputs. — location: [103](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=103) ^ref-51422

---
like growing revenue. That’s called managing impact. It’s a problem because it’s not specific enough. — location: [105](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=105) ^ref-8497

---
“what is the customer behavior change that we are looking for?” — location: [119](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=119) ^ref-4750

---
The simple answer is that you frequently can’t know in advance. — location: [130](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=130) ^ref-13604

---
This is why, when working with outcomes, you need a companion tool: the experiment. — location: [130](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=130) ^ref-53926

---
“what could we do to deliver value early?” — location: [136](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=136) ^ref-44464

---
So you can think of agile projects as a series of hypotheses and experiments, all designed to achieve an outcome. — location: [145](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=145) ^ref-34938

---
What you want is to manage with outcomes: ask teams to create a specific customer behavior that drives business results. That allows them to find the right solution, and keeps them focused on delivering value. For our purposes, an outcome is “a change in customer behavior that drives business results.” Defining outcomes in terms of customer behaviors creates a more customer-centric and user-centric way of working. Outcomes and Agility: using outcomes to direct the work of your teams unlocks your team’s creativity. They will work to find the best solution to the problem at hand in order to create the outcome you seek. — location: [156](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=156) ^ref-40393

---
increasing revenues, decreasing costs, increasing new business and market share, increasing revenue from existing customers, and increasing shareholder value. — location: [165](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=165) ^ref-1010

---
which, in our language are high-level or “impact” metrics. — location: [168](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=168) ^ref-13158

---
revenue into something that the folks who are doing the work can act on. — location: [172](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=172) ^ref-31069

---
In other words, they’ve got to break down “increase revenue” into smaller, actionable parts. — location: [172](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=172) ^ref-55318

---
For our purposes, we’re going to be strict about this definition: an outcome is “a change in human behavior that drives business results.” — location: [175](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=175) ^ref-16658

---
revenue, profit, margin, costs, and loyalty. Those things are important, but you can see that they’re not outcomes in the sense we’ve defined just now. Instead, they’re impacts—the sum of a whole lot of outcomes. — location: [179](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=179) ^ref-3363

“what are the customer behaviors that drive business results?” — location: [182](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=182) ^ref-40450

---
That’s a possible outcome: opening our newsletter more frequently. — location: [187](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=187) ^ref-1780

---
That’s another possible outcome: sharing t-shirt images more frequently. — location: [189](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=189) ^ref-19233

---
because outcomes are things people do, they’re both observable and measurable. — location: [191](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=191) ^ref-10958

---
if we can demonstrate that social sharing of t-shirt images increases return visit rate, then social sharing is a leading indicator. — location: [200](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=200) ^ref-7127

First, they are measures of what people are doing—in other words, they measure behavior. — location: [204](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=204) ^ref-65080

---
then we have to treat the ideas differently than if we know our ideas are true. We have to treat them as assumptions. — location: [212](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=212) ^ref-58511

---
We believe that if people share pictures of our t-shirts at a greater rate, it will prompt existing customers to return to our site at a greater — location: [216](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=216) ^ref-47917

---
We’ll know we’re right when we see a correlation between social shares and return visits. — location: [218](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=218) ^ref-46714

---
What are the user and customer behaviors that drive business results? (This is the outcome that we’re trying to create.) How can we get people to do more of those behaviors? (These are the features, policy changes, promotions, etc that we’ll do to try to create the outcomes.) How do we know that we’re right? (This uncovers the dynamics of the system, as well as the tests and metrics we’ll use to measure our progress.) — location: [237](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=237) ^ref-54923

---
How can we get people to do more of these behaviors? — location: [245](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=245) ^ref-37068

---
In this case, we’d have to test a number of questions—can we get people to share pictures of our shirts on Instagram, and whether or not this leads to more visits, and in turn, more purchases. — location: [255](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=255) ^ref-9504

---
Impact: reduce costs Outcome: fewer people calling tech support Output: improved usability of confusing features — location: [267](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=267) ^ref-17372

look at a concrete measure: are people’s behaviors changing? — location: [270](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=270) ^ref-39405

“what (user/customer/employee) behaviors has this initiative created that are driving business results?” — location: [279](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=279) ^ref-32985

If you express your Key Result as a measurable customer behavior, you almost automatically have a well-written OKR. — location: [302](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=302) ^ref-37967

---
Don’t mistake impact—high-level aspirational goals—for outcomes. Impact is important, but it’s too big for any one group to target. Use the magic questions to define outcomes: what are the human behaviors that drive business results? How can we get people to do more of these things? How will we know we’re right? Remember that by “humans” we mean customers, users, employees, stakeholders, or anyone involved in the system that we’re building. When you’re planning work, be clear about your assumptions. Be prepared to test your assumptions by expressing work as hypotheses. Test your hypotheses continuously by working in small iterations, experimenting, and responding to the data and feedback you collect. Use outcomes to track progress. Leading indicators tell you that you’re going to hit or miss your target. Lagging indicators show your target. Build an understanding of what behaviors lead to achieving the targets you seek. — location: [310](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=310) ^ref-6111

and ends up with a roadmap, but a different kind of roadmap than we’re used to seeing, an outcome-based roadmap. — location: [326](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=326) ^ref-22487

---
But that’s exactly what we’re doing when we build roadmaps around outputs. We’re promising a certain feature by a certain date. — location: [352](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=352) ^ref-28930

---
Instead of building plans around the outputs that you’ll make, it often makes more sense to plan around themes of work, problems to solve, or outcomes to deliver. — location: [354](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=354) ^ref-41091

you have to find a set or a system of related outcomes that taken together will create the result that you want. — location: [358](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=358) ^ref-13871

because we’re trying to visualize human behaviors, and customer journey maps are designed for exactly this purpose. — location: [363](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=363) ^ref-4905

---
So a customer journey map lets you see the behaviors in the system, which means that you can start to think about which behaviors you want to encourage, which behaviors you want to eliminate, and which ones might be missing. — location: [371](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QJ1Y8Y5&location=371) ^ref-50061

We believe that if we increase the rate at which buyers and sellers meet early in the process, it will lead to more successful transactions (as measured by X) and higher user satisfaction (as measured by NPS.)
