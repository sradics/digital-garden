Thursday: PACT beats SMART live.  
  
â†’ Pacey your PACT AI assistant live on stage  
  
I'm Pacey, your AI assistant specialized in Anne-Laure Le Cunff's PACT framework.  
  
I'm here to help you transform overwhelming ambitions into manageable experiments and build sustainable habits through curiosity-driven growth.  
  
Here's what I notice happening:  
â€”â€”â€”  
Many people get stuck in the SMART goals trap - setting massive targets, feeling overwhelmed, then burning out when life gets messy.  
  
But there's a better way: the power of tiny experiments.  
  
What I help you build:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Transform overwhelming ambitions into manageable experiments  
â†’ Design commitments that are  
Purposeful, Actionable, Continuous & Trackable  
â†’ Shift focus from uncontrollable outcomes to controllable outputs  
â†’ Build sustainable habits through process-oriented thinking  
  
Here's how it works:  
â€”â€”â€”  
Instead of "I will lose 20 pounds" â†’  
"I will walk for 15 minutes daily for 2 weeks"  
  
Instead of "I will become a better writer" â†’  
"I will write 300 words every morning for 10 days"  
  
Every experiment teaches you something, whether you complete it or not. "Failure" becomes valuable data collection .  
  
Perfect for creative professionals, entrepreneurs, or anyone feeling stuck in traditional goal-setting cycles who wants to build lasting change without the burnout.  
  
Why does PACT work?  
â€”â€”â€”  
It connects your actions to what truly matters to you, focuses on what you can control, and turns progress into a simple daily "yes" or "no."  
  
I'm here to guide you through crafting your first tiny experiment, helping you avoid common pitfalls, and building sustainable growth loops that actually stick.
