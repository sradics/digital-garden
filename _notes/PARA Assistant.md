"I've finally decided to reorganize my Obsidian setup, which contains a lot of information. After reviewing some sessions with Bastian, I realized I needed some advice from a consultant. I chose a free one called Second Brain Assistant, and it's been fantastic. I'm providing the assistant with the current structure using text transcripts of my folder and file names, and/or screenshots. We're going through my main folders one by one to develop a strategy to identify areas and projects. We've already had some discussions about this because I want a coherent structure without things being scattered, although some items will need to be moved to different areas. For example, in the screenshot, you can see that the "Resources" folder contains everything about AI knowledge, which makes sense. The assistant came back with a structure and considered my request for an MOC structure, even providing an example of how it could look. It might even write some of them later on. Thanks to Bastian for this helpful assistant. I expect to finish by tomorrow, so it shouldn't be a big dealâ€”just moving some data around."

These magic moments make me mighty proud.  

22 attendees have used my Second Brain Assistant  
to sort over their 10k+ files.  
  
This assistant also knows a lot about PARA - the actionability based organize approach that turns messy folders into four simple buckets: Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives

P.S.  
Curious _also_ about PARA?  
Next Learning Ecosystem Mastery Cohort starts mid July.

P.P.S.  
Just this post gave me the flywheel hunch.  
What if the assistant could answer your PARA questions  
with my additional 87 book highlights?  
  
Could your Second Brain build unstoppable momentum?
