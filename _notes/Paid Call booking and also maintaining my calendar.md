# Paid Call booking and also maintaining my calendar

[https://app.cal.com/](https://app.cal.com/)
+ individual meeting links 
+ payment can be added
+ has an integrated video player
+ API
+ plugins
+ is free for an individual
+ connects to Google calendar
+ QR code for session links

Seems to be more advanced than Calendly and for sure cheaper.
