# Parallel writing Name game
## Game Goal
Get your name written in full length

## Overall Setting
+ 4 customers
+ 1 developers
+ 1 time keeper
+ Flipchart to capture the times

## Iteration 1
+ Every customer hands in his empty sheet of paper
+ The developer asks for the 1st letter for customer 1 and writes it down, 1st letter customer 2 and writes it down ... repeat for 1st letter for all customers
+ Now repeat with 2nd letter of each name, again customer by customer
+ The time-keeper stops the time until the a first name is finished and and until all names are completed
+ Each customer stops the time until their name was written

## Iteration 2
+ Every customer hands in his empty sheet of paper
+ The developer asks for the 1st letter for customer 1 and writes it down, 2nd letter customer 1 and writes it down ... repeat for alle letters for customer 1
+ Now continue with 2nd customer and all letters and repeat until all customers are done
+ The time-keeper stops the time until the a first name is finished and and until all names are completed
+ Each customer stops the time until their name was written

## Reflect on learnings
Now start to reflection on observations, interpretations and learnings.


## Effects to be seen
+ When one full name is written it is much faster then writing multiple names in parallel
+ Also the overall time for writing all names gets shorter. This results from avoiding the context switching when changing the names and papers. You can also make this effect more visible by using a different color for each name. So that the developer has in addition to switching paper also to change the pen.
