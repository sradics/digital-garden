If you don't pay for prevention, you'll pay for cure

â†’ and It gets expensive
â†’ I payed for it!

I have one tooth I neglected in my childhood.
This ONE did cost me nearly $6000 so far.

I'm paying for cure, as I missed prevention!

I read 250 books, 90% I barely remember
Did I really spent lifetime, just to forget?
And do I pay extra for time to recall?

I'm paying for cure, as I missed prevention!

But here is the thing:

â†’ For the past 30 books I read
â‡¢ I remember the important facts

â†’ For the past 15 courses I took
â‡¢ I applied the learnings and remember it

â†’ For the past 550 articles I read
â‡¢ I got my distilled key insights

I did PREVENT, now I'm EARNing from it.

So, how can you avoid the huge costs later?

Prevent and LEARN HOW TO LEARN

â†’ Make LEARNING an experience with JOY
â†’ Be clever and use smart approaches
â†’ Use state of the art, simple tech
â†’ Form your daily learning habit 
âž  Be the Learning

It took me the past 3 years.
I learned how to learn. 
I brought back joy.

Now I help you getting there too. 
But instead of 3 years, you can take the FASTLANE

10 days left to my virtual MASTERCLASS 
â‡¢ where I help you LEARN HOW TO LEARN, retain and recall with ease

Is now your time? ðŸ¤—
