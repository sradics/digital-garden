üöÄ Peek into the 4 mirrors I used to see my professional self more clearly than ever  
  
Self-awareness is a crucial component of professional growth and team dynamics. Thanks to [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABI587YBSSrrBoMZzq0u8GJfc0P4sjJCwxY)[Quilco Hasemann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/quilco-hasemann-6724a886/)'s recommendation, I delved into the Clifton Strengths Finder and uncovered my top five strengths:  
‚ú™ Activator: I make things happen  
‚ú™ Intellection: I like to think  
‚ú™ Empathy: I can sense the emotions of those around me  
‚ú™ Learner: I love to learn  
‚ú™ Strategic: Isort through the clutter and find the best route  
  
These strengths, along with my qualities as an Achiever, Competitor, Maximizer, Arranger, and one who adapts, provide a comprehensive reflection of my approach to work and life. It provides me a mirror and reflection point. In addition I get names for my strengths and can describe it even better to others.  
  
The RedBull Wingfinder added another layer, painting me as:  
‚ù§Ô∏èüêÇ Very Balanced: Resilient, upbeat, and composed.  
‚ù§Ô∏èüêÇ Supportive: Eager to assist, open to ideas, with a team-centric vision.  
‚ù§Ô∏èüêÇ Agile: A logical problem-solver, objective and ever-learning.  
‚ù§Ô∏èüêÇ Classical: I value simplicity, pragmatism, and reliability.  
  
An EQ by TerraYou of 125 suggests strong self-awareness, organization, social competence, and empathy.  
  
Lastly, the DiSC assessment places me in the 'C' style: Analytical, reserved, and uncompromising on accuracy and quality.  
  
By intertwining these insights with guidelines on how to best work with me, I aim to offer my peers a window into who I am. It's a gesture of trust and an invitation to understand and appreciate our differences.  
  
I‚Äôll share my "How to Work with Me" manual in the comments below (thanks for your inspiration [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABjoILQB9XbiOmeeDmp8PGkKLdXwp_5Pxig)[Bianca Roitsch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bianca-roitsch/) and [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABbTRJoBDc-9uXTytaBWa1esy94dtdVNpS0)[Monique Pattison](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moniquepattison/).  
  
Feel free to explore and perhaps construct one for yourself.  
‚≠ê I'm eager to hear about your experiences and perspectives on the value of understanding one's strengths!

## Content preparation
Being aware about own strengths is of high value to leverage and extend these strengths and increase performance. Thanks for Quilco and recommending the Clifton Strenghts Strenghtfinder.  According to that test my 5 most developed strenghts out of a list of 34 are: 

+ Activator - make things happen
+ Intellection - like to think
+ Empathy - can sense the emotions of those around me
+ Learner - love to learn
+ Strategic - sort through the clutter and find the best route

followed by Achiever, Competition, Maximizer, Arranger, Adaptability. 

This matches super well. For me the value in such tests it that it provided me a mirror and reflection point. In addition I get names for my strengths and can describe it even better to others. And I can just share it with my team. 
In addition the test report also shows where I need to be careful with such strengths.

Another personal assessment that I really like is the RedBull Wingfinder. This test is a much more engaging and at the same time also a little more demanding. 

An my Wingfinder Talent Passport describes me as:
+ very balanced - high resilience, being upbeat, keeping a cool head
+ supportive - desire to help, openness to other opinions, group focus
+ agile - using reason to solve problems, being objective, learning constantly
+ classical - ability to keep things simple, pragmatic approach, with high reliability

With an EQ (Emotional Quotient) of 125 with strong development of self-awareness followed by self-organization, social competence and empathy. 

And with the DISC - Dominance-Influence-Steadiness-Conscientiousness I'm currently DISC style C - I tend to be analytical, reserved with focus on accuracy and quality. Oh yes. 

And I connect all of these insights and more instructions of how to work with me and share that with people I'm working with. This provides my peers an overview and insights about me as a person and is an important investment in building trust. I'm sharing something personal and make myself vulnerable. And other can connect on through their own awareness and we can also learn about our interesting differences.

I share my How to work with me in my comment. Maybe you find that interesting and want to use a similar format for yourself. Looking forward to your learnings and impressions.
