## Highlights
We are told to do work, but seldom understand why. We crave and deserve context. — location: [193](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004R1Q642&location=193) ^ref-51479

---
Lack of context creates waste, resulting in long work days, poor planning, and the inability to keep commitments outside the office. — location: [194](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004R1Q642&location=194) ^ref-17132

There’s a martial arts concept known as Shu Ha Ri, a cycle of learning where first you learn the basics, then you question them, and finally you find your own path. — location: [219](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004R1Q642&location=219) ^ref-3899

One thing was certain: in front of our board, we experienced our most intense focus, enthusiasm, and camaraderie. — location: [260](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004R1Q642&location=260) ^ref-61806

---
We were visualizing work, limiting our work-in-progress, pushing decisionmaking to the last responsible moment, and continuously striving to improve. We learned that understanding our work is the key to controlling it. In a manufacturing — location: [265](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004R1Q642&location=265) ^ref-43403

Lean is both a philosophy and a discipline which, at its core, increases access to information to ensure responsible decision making in the service of creating value. — location: [421](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004R1Q642&location=421) ^ref-20565

We begin to notice patterns (types of tasks most often delayed, tasks that require additional help), make distinctions (what work we enjoy, who we enjoy working with), and — location: [444](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004R1Q642&location=444) ^ref-64916

Good leaders provide enough management oversight to give a clear and coherent idea of vision and purpose, but not to the extent that they micromanage. — location: [466](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004R1Q642&location=466) ^ref-54681

Which is the most pressing task? Which tasks can I fit into this half hour before I leave for my meeting? Which tasks can I batch together? — location: [631](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004R1Q642&location=631) ^ref-57433

Which tasks did you do particularly well?          Which tasks made you feel good about yourself?         Which tasks were difficult to complete?         Were the right tasks completed at the right time?          Did the tasks completed provide value? — location: [645](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004R1Q642&location=645) ^ref-2861

To ensure THE PEN doesn’t become a glorified junk lane, assign it a WIP limit. You should never find your BACKLOG empty while THE PEN is filled with half done tasks. Always refer to THE PEN first when pulling tasks into DOING. — location: [686](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004R1Q642&location=686) ^ref-54802

As the freeway approaches 100% capacity, it ceases being a freeway. It becomes a parking lot. Capacity is an ineffective measure of throughput, and a horrible way to gauge what we can — location: [736](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004R1Q642&location=736) ^ref-56212

Personally and professionally, we often get stuck in “analysis paralysis.” We overcomplicate our situation, painstakingly planning to the minutest detail—details that, in the beginning, we have limited insight into. In the end, we allow the planning phase to stall the action phase. — location: [843](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004R1Q642&location=843) ^ref-2275

we have a primary goal (to live effectively), and supporting goals (to complete projects, to move sticky notes). — location: [871](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004R1Q642&location=871) ^ref-27333

Manage work with flow and throughput, not time and capacity.      2.   Like traffic, work doesn’t fit, it flows.      3.   Capacity is a spatial relationship, throughput is a flow relationship.      4.   WIP limits can change with context.      5.   Thoughtful prioritization and completion beats rigorous up-front planning.      6.   Understanding our options is liberating. — location: [923](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004R1Q642&location=923) ^ref-49055

That open space is called “slack.” We need slack in our workflow, we need space to adjust. — location: [986](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004R1Q642&location=986) ^ref-19846

Push systems tend to cause bottlenecks by ignoring natural capacity. — location: [1035](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004R1Q642&location=1035) ^ref-51193

not stretching themselves beyond their capacity. When management has little visibility into employee workload, they treat them as unconstrained resources capable of processing an infinite amount of work. — location: [1072](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004R1Q642&location=1072) ^ref-19241

1.  Life is a balance of order and chaos.      2.   Patterns and contexts are often emergent. Don’t lock yourself into plans before you have enough information.      3.   Our actions today impact our choices tomorrow.      4.   Pull, flow, and cadence give clarity to how we work and which options are appropriate to select.      5.   Push is a blind act. Pull is informed.      6.   Pulling is optimal, being pushed is inevitable. Semper Gumby. Always flexible. — location: [1090](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004R1Q642&location=1090) ^ref-47996

We obsess over getting stuff done, rather than getting the right stuff done, and at the right time. — location: [1166](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004R1Q642&location=1166) ^ref-65047

We need to give ourselves credit for laying the groundwork for these peak experiences. — location: [1206](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004R1Q642&location=1206) ^ref-38737

Once we understand what causes peak experiences, we can increase their frequency and duration, creating “plateau moments.” — location: [1208](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004R1Q642&location=1208) ^ref-57595

Without it, my steps were no longer explicit; the exercise value of walking became immeasurable. So long as it was without batteries, I unconsciously deprioritized walking because there was no control to satisfy.

In all three cases, late papers were penalized. Dr. Ariely found papers submitted by the class with dictated due dates had the best grades, while papers submitted by the class that set their own deadlines came in second.

In many instances, the actual value of telephone calls, visitors, and meetings that may veer off-topic can go unrealized until well into the future. You might meet with eight potential clients over the course of eight dinners, and hear from none of them until one calls six months later. That call results in one of their contacts giving you a contract worth millions. So were the other seven meetings a waste of your time? Should you have had only one meeting? How could you have possibly known in advance which of the eight was the “meeting of value?” — location: [1406](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004R1Q642&location=1406) ^ref-62793

While not all of us drag our heels on unwelcome tasks, we certainly might conveniently deprioritize them. By assigning them a color or shape that stands out, we are confronted with them piling up in our backlog. — location: [1457](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004R1Q642&location=1457) ^ref-18634

It is in this particular vein that we say Go ahead, turn up the heat on your backlog and sweat (out) the small stuff. Quickly process those five minute ankle-biters. The discomfort you experience is only temporary and in the end, a satisfying number of those tasks filling up your DONE column leaves you with a backlog that is healthy and relevant. Launch all missiles: Simple tasks that require little more than sending out a quick email are easy to pull into DOING. For the Time Capsule Approach however, DONE is the goal.
