I did! But this transformed for me.  
  
In the past 3 years, three pivotal discoveries changed everything:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ Smart Learning with a Second Brain - leading to:  
‚Üí Compounded Learning: Building on previous knowledge seamlessly.  
‚ÜíIncreased Efficiency: Learning accelerates and becomes more enjoyable.  
  
2Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Amplified Learning - leading to:  
‚ÜíSerendipity: AI reveals connections close to my thoughts.  
‚ÜíAlways Available Buddy: Learning anytime, anywhere.  
‚ÜíOptimized Steps: Enhancing efficiency in every learning phase.  
  
3Ô∏è‚É£ 4MAT Learning Cycle - leading to:

## Content preparation

Looking back I experienced several pivotal changes when it comes to learning.

For about 44 year of my life, learning was connotated with being tedious, overwhelming, time-consuming and rigid. 

3 pivotal discoveries on the past 3 years had a profound effect on my approach to learning and the outcomes I'm able to create:
+ The discovery of Smart Learning with a Second Brain resulting in:
	+ compounded learning - building learning on top of learning
	+ dramatically increase learning efficiency
	+ much more fun
+ AI amplified learning resulting in:
	+ serendipity - as something else helps be to discover connections by at the same time being very close to my thoughts
	+ have an always available learning buddy
	+ next level of efficiency, as you are able to further optimize learning steps
+ 4MAT learning cycle resulting in:
	+ higher level of meta cognition while learning. 
	+ having a recipe for designing trainings, what levels up my sharing approaches for knowledge
	
With these 3 magic moments, learning turned in my happiness factor. I realised that learning is meaning. 

Now I'm on my journey to help others to level up their experience with learning. Your way to learn can become engaging, manageable and efficient too.

Up for your next level? Let's connect and follow my next steps more closely. News upcoming soon.
