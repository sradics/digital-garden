8 days into my Pomodoro experiment, and the impact is undeniable.  
  
â†’ Here's what I've discovered:  
  
My PACT: (details: [https://lnkd.in/g6Hra8Hc](https://lnkd.in/g6Hra8Hc))  
â€”â€”â€”  
Use a daily Pomodoro sequence using Session for the next 10 days until 16.03.  
  
Learned from [Anne-Laure Le Cunff, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neuranne/) - let's use aÂ Plus-Minus-Next to reflect:  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
(Plus)  
â€”â€”â€”  
8 days in - Pomodoro shows a real impact  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
â†’ Finished a book in a day - 11 Pomodoro sessions, distraction-free, high focus.  
  
â†’ Outperformed on outreach - planned 100 contacts for the 4MAT Mastering Training Design workshop, achieved 130.  
  
â†’ Optimized LinkedIn morning routine - focused 25-minute slots for commenting, writing, and engagement.  
  
And for everyone starting, I highly recommend the app Session.  
â†’ Tracks 25-minute slots with visual progress indicators  
â†’ Provides ambient background sound  
â†’ Analyzes behavior patterns  
â†’ Manages breaks  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
(Minus)  
â€”â€”â€”  
Challenges to address in my next PACT:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Truly disconnecting during 5-minute breaks (phone distractions)  
  
â†’ Managing flow states - sometimes 25' converts to 2h  
(aligned with Pomodoro 2.0 concept)  
  
â†’ Improving daily activity planning to guide Pomodoro sessions  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
(Next)  
â€”â€”â€”  
My follow-up pact to manifest the routine:  
â€”â€”â€”  
My follow-up PACT (next 10 days, until 25.03):  
  
1. Dedicate first daily Pomodoro to defining the day's main goal  
2. Complete at least 2 additional Pomodoro sequences daily  
3. Maintain a detailed Pomodoro experience journal in daily notes  
4. Integrate Pomodoro planning into morning routine  
  
(Inspired by [Anne-Laure Le Cunff, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neuranne/)'s Tiny Experiments concept.)
