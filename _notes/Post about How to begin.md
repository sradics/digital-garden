## Content preparation
Major goals should be **daunting**, **important** and **thrilling** 
It is the qualities that our goals possess, that will make them worthy goals.

Sounds challenging right? Therefore it is super helpful to know HOW TO BEGIN.
## Step 1 - Sketch the goal
Do a first sketch of the goal to make the goal tangible. Combine it with quick word associations. For the word associations ask:

+ What makes this goal daunting?
+ Why is this important?
+ What makes it thrilling?

## Step 2 - Draft a Mission statement
Create a first mission statement  that expresses your draft in some sentences. This supports to combine your thoughts. And getting your thoughts together allows you to share with others and enrich your perspectives.

Nothing complicated, just invest some minutes!

## Step 3 - Do a Spousish Test
Do the **spousish** (with someone who really knows you) test.
+ reality check
+ catch problems
+ discover blind spots

Watch out for extreme reactions. Take what is value adding and at the same time leave out what does not resonate! 

## Step 4 - Goldy locks zone test
Is the goal too small or too big? Look for the perfect spot.
Tweak the sketch and mission statement.

## Step 5 - Add SPICE
Add some spice to the goal:
+ Can you aim higher?
+ Change timeline
+ Include team power?
+ Extend reach?
+ Lift outcomes?

Change the mission statement and experiment with powerful verbs and adjectives.

ideas for verbs: ignite, forge, pioneer, surmount, eradicate, mobilize, enrich, foster, orchestrate, amplify

ideas for adjectives: innovative, impactful, revolutionary, dynamic, empowering, resilient, visionary, transformative, unprecedented, pioneering

## Step 6 - Status Quo and Rewards check
Weigh the comfort of inaction against the thrill of pursuit.

What are the benefits of NOT taking on that goal? 
What are the rewards for not doing it?
What are the costs of **not** pursuing the goal?

## Step 7 - Move forward
**MOVE** ... with small steps, but MOVE.
And do a recap of your progress and success every 6 weeks.
