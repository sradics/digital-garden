How I turn scattered marketing genius into a personal goldmine  
  
â†’ Warning: This marketing hack might make you too smart  
  
I learn a great deal from examples.  
At the moment, I'm immersing myself in  
the Five Lightbulbs Marketing by [Billy Broas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billybroas/).  
  
One insight I gained while working through Billy's Five Lightbulbs Live course is:  
  
Build your own swipe file with examples for good marketing.  
  
A swipe file is a collection of excellent examples to  
learn from and "borrow" ideas.  
  
Usually these marketing pages are very long.  
They contain images, text, links, and a lot to digest.  
  
I asked myself...  
How can I organize my swipe file so that:  
â€”â€”  
â†’ I can review the landing page in one go  
â†’ Have it available for future reference  
(usually, such landing pages get deleted once the main event has concluded)  
â†’ Add my learnings and thoughts  
â†’ Connect swipes by context  
  
Here's what I came up with:  
Following Billy's suggestion, I installed GoFullPage.  
  
GoFullPage is a brilliantly simple Chrome browser plugin that allows me to capture a complete, often very long landing page in one piece.  
  
Let's consider an example:  
For me, [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAKCWZYB0BJT397p4ZgCANFOp93epEb3djc)[Tiago Forte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiagoforte/) is a master of brilliant, argumentation-based marketing.  
He currently has enrollment open for his amazing Annual Review 2025 (you can find a link in the comments).  

Tiago's landing page is a masterpiece built on years of experience with argumentation-based marketing.  
  
I want to learn from Tiago's example!  
  
To learn, I take the following steps:  
â€”â€”  
1) I capture a full version of the landing page in one PDF file using GoFullPage.  
2) Next, I embed the PDF in Excalidraw, where I can make annotations on each element.  
  
Excalidraw is a plugin for my note-making app, Obsidian, that helps me visualize my thoughts.  
  
3) I then analyze the structure.  
  
â†’ What is the sequence of the argumentation?  
â†’ What is the approach, and what is the offer?  
â†’ What words and images are used?  
â†’ What packages are used?  
  
4) I add annotations directly at the elements  
5) I take notes on my insights  
6) Later, I'll introduce Maps of Content, where I can group insights from various analyzed landing pages.  
  
Instead of having scattered notes,  
I integrate my insights into my Personal Knowledge Management System.  
  
This way, I can learn from great examples over time.  
I can connect insights from many places.  
I learn step by step from each example.  
  
This was a brief outline of my approach to learning from great marketing examples.
