Workshops, relocations, and presentations, oh my!  
  
â†’ 5 strategies for when everything happens at once  
  
Ever wonder how to navigate those weeks  
when everything seems to happen at once?  
  
Here's my current experience and how I'm managing it:  
  
My current workload:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ My relocation: Berlin to Halberstadt  
â†’ Supporting the Five Lightbulbs Live workshop  
â†’ My Ella Forums presentation on Second Brain & AI  
([https://lnkd.in/eyMVqjP9](https://lnkd.in/eyMVqjP9))  
  
â†’ Participating in the NoteMaking Mastery Workshop  
â†’ Two Agile workshops I'm running (Teams & Kanban)  

âž  It is a lot.  
  
âž  I can feel the pressure.  
  
âž  But I choose not to dwell on that feeling  

In such times, where focus and timing matter,  
I rely on a strong foundation built with these five components:  
â€”â€”â€”  
1. My Second Brain system  
â†’ I quickly access building blocks and meta-information  
â†’ You can retrieve insights efficiently, saving hours of searching  
  
2. Todoist as my task manager  
â†’ I maintain a clear overview of what needs to be done  
â†’ You can prioritize and track your tasks effectively  
  
3. AI assistants at my fingertips  
â†’ I leverage AI capabilities for various tasks  
â†’ You can explore AI to enhance your productivity  
  
4. My extensive workshop experience  
â†’ I draw on two decades of design and facilitation expertise  
â†’ You can build and value your unique experiences  
  
5. My mental and physical fitness  
â†’ I'm prepared for high-intensity periods  
â†’ You can invest in your wellbeing for resilience  

Invest in developing your own systems for crunch-time readiness.  
  
You'll thank yourself later!  
  
I'm here to support you on the  
'What' and 'How' of building your system.  
  
What's your ONE go-to crunch-time lifesaver?  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
P.S.  
I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease
