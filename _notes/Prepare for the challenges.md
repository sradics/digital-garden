My 8-hour move went perfectly.

â†’ Then came the 8+ hour battle you won't see coming

Moving is quite a complex undertaking. 

Lots of topics to consider, many things where mistakes can happen. 

We arrived well yesterday after our move from Berlin to Halberstadt. 

All went smoothly
â†’ Renting a car for transport and even getting that BIG car routed through a very narrow parking garage without any scratches.

â†’ Loading the car with all the stuff we had packaged before.

â†’ Putting the first batch in a local storage unit we rented, then moving the second batch to our new home.

Took us about 8 hours. All went super well. 

You know what took me at least that long too? 
Something that should be super easy. 
But sometimes things go sideways.

Getting the internet up an running. 
I'm still working through some connection problems. 
(Telekom Speedport Pro Plus ...)

But, as I assumed this might happen. 
I invested in a backup plan.

I bought an LTE card from another vendor too.
I'm quite happy that this is now available. 

As internet is a critical component that has to work for us,
better be prepared, right. 

Now looking forward to the main internet connection being fixed.
But with a relaxed posture, right. 

When was the last time a backup solution did carry you through?
