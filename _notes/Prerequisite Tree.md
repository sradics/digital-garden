This network is a **map from where you are, to where you want to be**. But the waypoints along that path are not “things you have to do.” That leaves you individually responsible for walking every step, expecting no help from anyone or anything.

They are “things that must be true.” And there are _many_ ways for one of those statements to flip from “not true” to “true” that don’t require your direct effort: changes in the economy, software programs coming out with new features, shifts in the competitive landscape, new people coming into your life.

By mapping out the network of necessary conditions for a new reality to emerge, you are **opening yourself up to serendipity**.
