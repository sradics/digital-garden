ðŸ§  Growing a Second Brain:  
Techniques to expand your mental capabilities.  
  
ðŸŒ± Expressing and Sharing Thoughts in a Digital Garden:  
Creating a space for your ideas to flourish.

A special thanks to [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAABu4oIBhM9AaaXVclPPngaKlvVKKy-FogU)[Hanne Houbak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanne-houbak-4aa5252/) for the opportunity to sketch the session during the 4MAT Master Training Design.Â Integrating these insights into the 4MAT PERFORM stage allowed me to complete a full 4MAT learning cycle!  
  
Now, Iâ€™m eager to share these insights with a broader audience.  
Check out the attached slides for a sneak peek into the workshop.

Amplify your Second Brain ðŸ§  and Digital Garden ðŸŒ± with AI
(Insights from Presenting at Ness Labs community)

On 04.06. I ran a workshop for the Ness Labs community and shared insights about:
ðŸ§  Growing a Second Brain 
ðŸŒ± Expressing and sharing thoughts in a Digital Garden
ðŸ¤– Leveraging AI for Capture-Organize-Distill-Express information processing

Thanks Hanne Houbak for providing me the opportunity to already sketch the session during the 4MAT Master Training Design. It was working pretty good! 
And by providing the presentation as part of the 4MAT PERFORM stage I closed a full 4MAT learning cycle. 

Now I'm looking to provide these insights to a wider audience.
The attached Slides provide a sneak preview about the workshop. 

Are you interested in joining such a workshop too? Please let me know in the comments. Based on your interest I might set up a LinkedIn live session next!
