## Content preparation

In order to make content engaging and effective in our group coaching sessions we apply the 12 principles for effective Learning Content. 

12 principles as guidance
+ Coherence principle - eliminate use of irrelevant images and slide decorations
+ Signaling principle - HIGHLIGHT or BOLD essential text or add elements one at a time
+ avoid Redundancy principle - explain it verbally without also providing a textual explanation on a slide
+ Spatial Contiguity principle - place related elements close 
+ Temporal Contiguity principle - present related material simultaneously (e.g. combine instructions in breakout session alongside a model)
+ Pre-Training principle - introduce key concepts/terminology either before or at the start of a session
+ Modality principle - balance how much you say and attendees have to read. We learn best from visuals and spoken words, opposed to visuals and printed words.
+ Multimedia principle - combine e.g. words and images
+ Segmenting principle - break content into segments. With a meaningful interaction every 5 minutes - to access understanding 
+ Use human voice principle - implemented by using coaching and facilitation by our awesome Coaches
+ Personalization principle - use conversational language
+ Image principles - Â Show relevant visuals on the screen instead of a talking head.
