4 principles for mastering AI collaboration  
  
â†’ even if you're just starting out  
  
As AI continues to evolve,  
itâ€™s crucial to establish some ground rules  
  
â†³ to maintain control  
â†³ to avoid common pitfalls  
t's dive into the 4 principles:  
Inspired by ðŸ“– Co-Intelligence  
Living and Working with AI  
by Ethan Mollick  
  
  
 ALWAYS INVITE AI to the table (AI First)  
  
â†’ Use AI to assist you in everyday tasks.  
â†’ Consider how AI might reshape your role.  
â†’ Explore how AI can innovate your workflow.  
  
  
2) Treat AI LIKA A PERSON  
  
â†’ AI is fast and knowledgable but not flawless  
â†’ Use as coeditor. Co-create in a dialogue  
For example I use Switch Writing for my content

â†’ Tell it to act like a particular person  
  
ðŸ¤– â€” Persona briefing example  
"You are an expert at marketing. When asked to generate slogan ideas you come up with ideas that are different from each other, clever, and interesting. You use clever wordplay..."  
â€” ðŸ¤–

3) Assume this is the WORST AI you'll ever use  
  
â†’ No reason that AI stops growing anytime soon  

â†³ Courses (e.g. LinkedIn)  
â†³ Books (e.g. Co-Intelligence)  
â†³ Communities (e.g. AI Exchange)  
â†³ Newsletters (e.g. [Insidr.ai](http://insidr.ai/), The AI Solopreneur)  
  
  

â†’ Check for hallucinations and lies  
â†’ Stay responsible and accountable  
align AIâ€™s work with ethics and human values.  
â†’ Discover sparks of growing intelligence early
