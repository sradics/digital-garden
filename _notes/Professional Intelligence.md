AI handles IQ.  
  
â†’ But can you master these 5 other intelligences?  
  
I just read "Professionelle Intelligenz" by Gunter Dueck.  
  
Did you know that professional success relies on  
six distinct types of intelligence:  
â€”â€”  
â†’ IQ - "normal" intelligence of our brains  
â‡¢ Processing information  
â‡¢ Learning and understanding  
â‡¢ Applying knowledge  
  
â†’ EQ - emotional intelligence of our heart and collaboration  
â‡¢ Heart-centered collaboration  
â‡¢ Empathetic connections  
â‡¢ Understanding others  
  
â†’ VQ - vital intelligence of instinct and taking action  
â‡¢ Taking decisive action  
â‡¢ Leadership capability  
â‡¢ Persuasion skills  
  
â†’ AQ - attraction intelligence of sensualism, joy  
â‡¢ Creating appeal  
â‡¢ Generating enthusiasm  
â‡¢ Sales and influence  
  
â†’ CQ - creative intelligence of creativity and curiosity  
â‡¢ Innovation mindset  
â‡¢ Curiosity-driven thinking  
â‡¢ Problem-solving  
  
â†’ MQ - Intelligence of being meaningful  
â‡¢ Purpose-driven actions  
â‡¢ Value creation  
â‡¢ Lasting impact  
  
With AI increasingly handling IQ-based tasks, developing these other intelligences becomes crucial for future success.  
  
Ready for a quick self-assessment?  
  
Rate yourself from 1-6 in each area:  
â€”â€”  
1 = Unaware - Never heard of it  
2 = Aware - Heard of it  
3 = Knowledge - I know about it and consider it as important  
4 = Skill - I apply it already on basic level  
5 = Mastery - I'm an expert and apply it professionally  
6 = World-Class -Â I'm a guru in this field and teach it to others too  

Then ask yourself:  
â€”â€”  
Scoring 1-2: What opportunities are you missing?  
Scoring 3: What's one action step to move from knowledge to application?  
Scoring 4: Is expertise in this area worth pursuing?  
Scoring 5: How can you help others grow?  
Scoring 6: Share your expertise - others need your guidance!  
  
Looking for growth in 2025?  
I guess you found a potential direction.
