# Progressive Summarization
[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWFKoVbSwGo)
## 1st pass
* Use **bold** and highlights on the highlights from a book. 
* Just mark the areas that express the key point from a highlight and that are surprising and/or something new
* Don't drill down on a topic. You can do this later. So touch lightly, move quickly.
* For a book it takes around 1-2 hours
* Do the 1-pass processing e.g. in the evening

# 2nd pass
* working with ==yellow highlighting== to make it even more visible what the ballparks are. Just look on the **bold** marked items
* things that should really peak your interest in a year from now
* what jumps out
* things that we separated in the source come closer and one can see the connections
* 1/3 of the time of pass #1

# 3rd pass
Learned from Blinkist Guide with Tiago Forte
+ extract the distilled highlights and write it in your own structure and words
+ *addition by me*: add Linking, Comments
