Prompting is dead. Here's what replaced it.

â†’ This transformed how I work with AI completely

I used to think prompting was the peak of AI interaction. 
Then I discovered assistants.

Here's what I discovered about the difference.

When you prompt, you start from scratch every time. 
You explain your context, your needs, your preferences. 
The AI gives you a generic response based on its training.

But when you work with an assistant, something different happens.
Everything changed when I shifted my approach.

I stopped seeing them as tools. 
I started seeing them as a specialized workforce.

Each assistant has a specific role: 
â†’ like my Five Lightbulbs Marketing Assistant. 
â†’ like my Second Brain Assistant.
â†’ like my Hookline Assistant. 

Each one:
â†’ knows my context deeply because 
I've fed it content from my Second Brain. 

â†’ follows specific workflows 
instead of giving generic responses. 

â†’ integrates with my daily operations.

I now have 40 assistants working as my extended team. 

They're not replacing my thinking. They're amplifying it.

That's the real breakthrough. 
When you move from prompting to assistants, 
you move from asking for help to building a team.

In Week 6 of the Learning Ecosystem Mastery program, you'll:
â†’ discover the four key components of building powerful assistants
â†’ see real examples of assistants that transform productivity 
â†’ get step-by-step guidance to build your own

P.S. The video is from my Idea Explorer assistant. 
I asked it to describe itself, how it looks like and what it does.
Took that to Descript, that created the video and avatar
