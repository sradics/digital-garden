60 newsletters and >100 attention grabbers

â†’ I must avoid information overload

â€”â€”â€” JUST A NORMAL INFLOW â€”â€”â€”
â†’ I subscribed to 60 different newsletters
â†’ Scan 100+ online sources per week
â†’ Watch videos, listen to podcasts

âž  Isn't it a crazy amount of information

I adjusted and implemented my filter approach:
â†³ I use the read-later app Matter between 

Typical situations when I pick from Matter

â†’ I wait in queue, hands free
â†’ I want to discover something
â†’ I have 5-10 minutes in between

âž  Matter integrates in my capture stage
âž  Where I apply five steps to distill insights

â†’ Forward instead of consume immediately
â†’ Read/Listen when in processing mode
â†’ Highlight very important parts
â†’ Import highlights as notes
â†’ Integrate on demand

This helps me to avoid information overload

â†’ all in on place: Newsletters, Podcasts, Video
â†’ with peace of mind of having it saved
â†’ distraction free reading+listening
â†’ integrated AI summariser

Matter integrates in the Second Brain apprWhere its all about information an the CODE:
â†³ Capture
â†³ Organize
â†³ Distill
â†³ Express
