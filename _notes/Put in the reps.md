The LinkedIn strategy 99% aren't committed to  
  
â†’ and the 3 bets I'm making  
  
Soon, it will be 1 year of daily writing on LinkedIn.  
  
Radical candor - it is challenging.  
  
Follow this brief minute-by-minute journal that describes my daily approach.  
â€”â€”â€”  
5 am - let's start the journey...  
  
1) Following up comments on my post (15-20')  
2) Commenting on my peer's posts (1h)  
(Coffee)  
3) Writing my post (1h)  
4) Connecting with new people (15')  
5) Commenting and heavy engagement phase (1h)  
  
now it is about 9:30 am  
  
In the evening (not steady)  
6) Commenting (30')  
â€”â€”â€”  

That is about 5h of learning, engaging, networking in LinkedIn.  
Every day!  

But what for?Â I place three bets!  
(And I'm still figuring out if that works in the long run)  
  
These are my three bets:  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
1 â†’ Building authority matters.  
â€”â€”â€”  
Through daily writing and engagement people get to know my approach, my style and me. It builds trust.  

â€”â€”â€”  
2 â†’ I reach more people over time.  
â€”â€”â€”  
I want to talk to as many as possible.  
LinkedIn with 1,000,000,000 users.  
  
Over time I can play the numbers game.  
  
My approach for Learning how to Learn is for the Fastlaners and Aspirants  
(see details in [https://lnkd.in/erK78hx8](https://lnkd.in/erK78hx8)).  
  
A potential to reach many!  

But:  
â†’ I need to cut through the busy, noisy layers  
  
âž  Daily writing creates the chance to reach the right person at the right time  
âž  I bet on these moments.  

â€”â€”â€”  
3 â†’ I can develop and validate my core message and assumptions  
â€”â€”â€”  
My core assumption is that Learning how to Learn matters.  
  
That when we upgrade our approach to learning,  
we can achieve any goals faster. Again and again.  
  
That people pay for the Fastlane to Smarter Learning,  
instead of investing years to figure that out by themselves  
or even worse - never start.  
  
Through each day on LinkedIn, I:  
  
â†’ Learn about writing styles  
â†’ Pick up tools and approaches  
â†’ Get to know other authors over time  
â†’ Meet my audience and learn what is important for you  

What is ONE bet you place?  

â€”â€”â€”  
P.S.  
I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease
