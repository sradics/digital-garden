# Quote about Team Learning
[Source Parta.io](https://parta.io/)

“Productivity is not driven by each individual in a company.
 Most individuals in your company already work as hard as they can. It's by organizational design, it's by the organization being more focused, it's by teaching people how to work together”. *Josh Bershin*
