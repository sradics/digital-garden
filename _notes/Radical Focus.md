## Highlights
“Don’t tell people how to do things, tell them what you need done and let them surprise you with their results.” — location: [15](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=15) ^ref-46360

The first principle is really about how to motivate people to get them to do their best work, and the second is all about how to meaningfully measure progress. — location: [18](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=18) ^ref-32697

---
The teams are just there to flesh out the details, code and test, with little understanding of the bigger context, and even less belief that these are in fact the right solutions. Teams today are all too often feature factories, — location: [26](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=26) ^ref-17242

---
with little regard for whether or not the features actually solve the underlying business problems. Progress is measured by output and not outcome. This book is intended to help all organizations — location: [28](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=28) ^ref-48536

It’s that ideas are easier to come up with than you think. What’s hard — really hard— is moving from an idea to reality. — location: [42](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=42) ^ref-25762

---
One: set inspiring and measurable goals. Two: make sure you and your team are always making progress toward that desired end state. No matter how many other things are on your plate. And three: set a cadence — location: [52](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=52) ^ref-11147

---
Objective is what you want to do (Launch a killer game!), Key Results are how you know if you’ve achieved them (“Downloads of 25K/Day,” “Revenue 50K/Day”). OKRs are set annually and/or quarterly and unite the company behind a vision. — location: [57](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=57) ^ref-1119

---
The Objective is inspiring and motivates those people who don’t dig numbers. For those who do love numbers, — location: [59](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=59) ^ref-38768

So a solution is to time-constrain things that are important but not urgent, thus making them urgent. — location: [65](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=65) ^ref-63150

The OKRs set goals. The weekly priorities remind you to achieve them. — location: [72](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=72) ^ref-47765

He wrote: “Customer Satisfaction: Green” in the lower right. “This way we force a discussion each week about whether our customers are still happy. Lots of stuff can go here.” — location: [713](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=713) ^ref-13782

He moved to the left side of the napkin, and wrote “P1” three times, and “P2” twice. — location: [726](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=726) ^ref-64198

“Here you write the three to five big things you will do this week to affect the OKRs. You share them, so you,” he nodded — location: [728](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=728) ^ref-43954

You list the things that must happen or you’re not going to make your Objectives. Life always gives you plenty to do. The secret is not forgetting the things that matter.” — location: [731](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=731) ^ref-28562

First of all, we are only going to have one OKR for the company. — location: [838](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=838) ^ref-35780

“Secondly, we will set OKRs for each group that ties back to the company goal. — location: [841](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=841) ^ref-24047

Third, we are going to set a confidence level for our Key Results. — location: [841](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=841) ^ref-27362

“From now on, we’ll use this as our format. It shouldn’t take your more than ten minutes each week to update this model. The first one may take a bit longer of course, but after that it’s just edits. — location: [847](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=847) ^ref-44649

Just the big stuff, the stuff that they can help with, or at least should be aware of. — location: [864](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=864) ^ref-50074

This is just to keep us all on the same page, in case we need to buy servers or get marketing ready. — location: [867](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=867) ^ref-41633

“There you go. We value the things we make together. We’re going to set our Objectives together. We’re going to pick Key Results as a team. And we are going make them as a team, too. This is our company. We succeed or fail together.” — location: [888](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=888) ^ref-10713

the Friday “wins session” (as they started to call it) gave everybody the hope to keep trying. — location: [924](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=924) ^ref-21909

“You know, setting goals we know we can make. To feel good about ourselves. Instead of setting real stretch goals.” — location: [930](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=930) ^ref-59988

One: We haven’t prioritized our goals. — location: [961](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=961) ^ref-41943

---
“If everything is important, nothing is important.” — location: [962](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=962) ^ref-37804

Once you’ve prioritized them, choosing to work on them one at a time has a much higher incidence of success. — location: [964](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=964) ^ref-61697

you can get many goals to move forward. But the reality is, running a company takes work all by itself. Each — location: [966](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=966) ^ref-7194

---
Add to that the background noise of a — location: [967](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=967) ^ref-16479

---
half dozen goals, and you assure very little beyond the bare necessities will happen. — location: [967](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=967) ^ref-18576

---
By setting a single Objective with only three Key Results to measure it, you can provide the kind of focus needed to achieve great things despite life’s little distractions. — location: [968](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=968) ^ref-5111

Two: We haven’t communicated the goal obsessively and comprehensively. “When you are tired of saying it, people are starting to hear it” – Jeff Weiner, CEO of LinkedIn — location: [970](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=970) ^ref-49877

---
you have to reiterate it daily. — location: [972](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=972) ^ref-49266

---
Progress toward the goal must be marked in status meetings and weekly status emails. — location: [973](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=973) ^ref-53653

---
To set a goal and then ignore it is an easy recipe for failure. — location: [974](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=974) ^ref-54366

---
continually repeating the goal every Monday in the commitment meetings, in the weekly status emails and in the Friday wins celebrations, we assure that the goal is in the front of everyone’s mind and tied to all activities. — location: [975](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=975) ^ref-8996

---
Once we know the one thing we must make happen, we think willpower is enough. Just Do It, right? Wrong. — location: [977](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=977) ^ref-35862

---
That’s because willpower is a finite resource. — location: [979](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=979) ^ref-28929

You need a process that helps you make sense of the work you need to do, and keeps you on track even when you are tired. — location: [983](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=983) ^ref-35091

---
The original OKR system was just a way to set smart stretch goals. But the system around it— commitment, celebrations, check ins— makes sure you continue to make progress toward your goals even when you feel more like eating a cookie. — location: [985](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=985) ^ref-11205

Five: We give up instead of iterate. — location: [993](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=993) ^ref-29941

---
However, the successful ones all have the same characteristic: they try again. The only hope for success is iteration. This does not mean blindly trying the same thing over and over again. — location: [1002](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=1002) ^ref-3863

The heart of success is learning. — location: [1005](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=1005) ^ref-45097

Before Starting OKRs, Check Your Mission — location: [1011](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=1011) ^ref-64328

They don’t have to be great works of poetry. They do have to be simple, memorable and act as guide when you make a decision about how to spend your time. A good mission is short enough everyone in the company can keep it in their head. — location: [1021](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=1021) ^ref-62782

Great missions are inspirational, yet directed. — location: [1023](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=1023) ^ref-61918

To make one, start with this simple formula: We [reduce pain/improve life] in [market] by [value proposition]. — location: [1029](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=1029) ^ref-45999

---
In many ways, a mission and an Objective in the OKR model have a lot in common; they are aspirational and memorable. The key difference is time scale. — location: [1033](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=1033) ^ref-57081

---
An Objective takes you through a year or a quarter. A mission should last a lot longer. — location: [1034](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=1034) ^ref-31664

---
Using OKRs without a mission is like using jet fuel without a jet. It’s messy, undirected and potentially destructive. — location: [1035](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=1035) ^ref-6876

---
The Objective is qualitative, and the KRs (most often three) are quantitative. — location: [1042](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=1042) ^ref-41402

---
Your Objective is a single sentence that is: Qualitative and Inspirational — location: [1044](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=1044) ^ref-8218

The Objective is designed to get people jumping out of bed in the morning with excitement. — location: [1046](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=1046) ^ref-46152

If it takes a year, your Objective may be a strategy or maybe even a mission.

Do not change OKRs halfway through the quarter. If you see you’ve set them badly, suck it up and either fail or nail them, and use that learning to set them better next time. — location: [1104](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=1104) ^ref-23678

A product team is a cross-functional set of professionals, typically comprised of a product manager, a product designer, and a small number of engineers. — location: [1119](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=1119) ^ref-54644

Each product team typically is responsible for some significant part of the company’s product offering or technology. — location: [1121](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=1121) ^ref-48412

What all too often happens in this case is that the actual people on the product teams are conflicted as to where they should be spending their time, resulting in confusion, frustration and disappointing results from leadership — location: [1139](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=1139) ^ref-14299

Goals work when they’re inspiring and capture our natural intention for greatness. They should describe what great victory is for every team, and be a real-time rather than one-time rally point for people. When they’re tangible, they provide purpose which improves everyone’s contribution and provides a focal point for day-to-day execution. By defining clear short term goals and metrics, you’ve defined priorities and given people permission to focus on the most valuable activities.  (Leaders often overestimate how well people understand their goals – just 7% of people really do!) — location: [1435](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=1435) ^ref-54411

Pure hierarchies rarely work today; organizations that focus on teaming and leading across each level are more agile and successful.  When goals only flow top down in large organizations, opportunities – maybe even markets -- are lost. Talented people and great ideas are everywhere in an organization; let their aspirations flow and you’ll be unstoppable.  Rather than an over-rigid down line cascade that assumes the chief knows all, converge on goals so innovation isn’t stifled and broader strategies progress smoothly. — location: [1454](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BFKJA0Y&location=1454) ^ref-19328
