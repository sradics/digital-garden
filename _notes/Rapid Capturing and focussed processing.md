[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_secondbrain-efficiency-productivity-activity-7154820795981053952-U1Tg?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

Unlock Focus and Efficiency: Decouple Information Capturing from Processing! 🧠✨  
  
Ever stumbled upon an interesting website, video, or article only to lose focus from your current task?  
  
I have, and I found the solution - use a read later app. I'm using matter (see link in the comment) 🎯  
  
✪ Matter has transformed how I consume information. It's integrated in my browser, and with a simple Ctrl+M, I capture any content that piques my interest. 🖥️ It even automatically transcribes Podcasts and Video content.  
✪ I've made capturing even more seamless by writing a small Google script that forwards emails labeled to Matter. 📧  
✪ Subscribing to newsletters using my Matter email address directly populates my Matter library with curated content. 📚  
✪ Matter is also available on my phone, integrated into the context menu for quick captures on-the-go. 📲  
  
This system of capturing allows me to delay content consumption without the fear of losing it. The result? More focus and peace of mind. 🧘‍♂️  
  
When I'm ready to consume, I dive into my Matter library and choose an item that sparks interest. Matter provides a distraction-free reading and listening experience, eliminating ads, and enabling me to scan for the main content.  
  
While reading, I highlight crucial aspects, forming my first stage of processing.🚀  
  
The key insights get automatically imported into my [hashtag#SecondBrain](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=secondbrain&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7154820795981053952), maintained with Obsidian. Whenever I want to follow up on an insight, it's ready in my workflow. 🌐  
  
This decoupling of capturing from processing creates a balance between preserving an idea and finding the right time to work on it. It's not just about [hashtag#efficiency](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=efficiency&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7154820795981053952) ; it's about forming a habit and finding satisfaction in the process. 🌟

## Content

+ When I find something of interest - be it a website, a video, an article, a recommendation I immediately safe that to Matter. 
+ I made that capturing step super easy: 
	+ It is integrated in my Browser and I do capture via Ctrl+M
	+ I wrote a little google script where based on a label an eMail is forward to Matter
	+ I subscribe to Newsletters using my Matter eMail address
	+ Matter is available on my phone to and integrated in the context menu
+ Mattering items frees me from my immediate wish to consume content. Rather I can easily delay without losing it. I observed that this habit creates peace of mind and helps me to focus on the topic I'm at when such an information appears
+ When I have a moment where I'm in the mood to read I open my Matter library, pick a topic that sparks interest and start reading. Ads are removed and I have a distraction free version, that I can scan for main content. While reading I do first stage highlighting of crucial aspects. 
+ My highlighted key insights get automatically important to my Second Brain that I maintain with Obsidian. And whenever I would like to follow up on such an insight I can use it right away in my work. 

Decoupling capturing from processing helps to stay focussed. It creates a balance between not losing an idea and finding the right time to work on an idea. Making capturing and further processing as lightweight as possible helps to form a habit and also brings me statisfaction with being efficient and not wasting time with too much manual processing.
