# [[Rapid Capturing and focussed processing]]

## Key points
+ When I find something of interest - be it a website, a video, an article, a recommendation I immediately safe that to Matter. 
+ I made that capturing step super easy: 
	+ It is integrated in my Browser and I do capture via Ctrl+M
	+ I wrote a little google script where based on a label an eMail is forward to Matter
	+ I subscribe to Newsletters using my Matter eMail address
	+ Matter is available on my phone to and integrated in the context menu
+ Mattering items frees me from my immediate wish to consume content. Rather I can easily delay without losing it. I observed that this habit creates peace of mind and helps me to focus on the topic I'm at when such an information appears
+ When I have a moment where I'm in the mood to read I open my Matter library, pick a topic that sparks interest and start reading. Ads are removed and I have a distraction free version, that I can scan for main content. While reading I do first stage highlighting of crucial aspects. 
+ My highlighted key insights get automatically important to my Second Brain that I maintain with Obsidian. And whenever I would like to follow up on such an insight I can use it right away in my work. 

Decoupling capturing from processing helps to stay focussed. It creates a balance between not losing an idea and finding the right time to work on an idea. Making capturing and further processing as lightweight as possible helps to form a habit and also brings me statisfaction with being efficient and not wasting time with too much manual processing.
