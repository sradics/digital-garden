# [[Rapid Fire Writing]]

## LinkedIn Post

5 words. 10 seconds. Infinite creativity.

→ Every Exciting Road Can Inspire

During the inspiring NoteMaking Mastery course from Nick Milo we use a Rapid Fire writing exercise. 

It works like this: 
→ Take a word
→ Write about that word for 5-10 seconds
→ Repeat that for 5 words

This exercise:
→ Warms up your writing and brain
→ And it might create a spark too

While that exercise is a great icebreaker for sessions, 
there is actually more to it.

It reminds me of the word association exercise I first learned from Vera Birkenbihl several years ago. (Who remembers KAWA and KAGA?)

One takes these word associations to look at a topic from various perspectives. 

So, I took it a step further. 
I asked myself: Where can I get such a list of words from?

What if I could ask my Second Brain for that?

→ My ChatGPT is connected to my notes I maintain in my Second Brain. 

And I asked, based on a list of 30 notes I created recently: 

"Pick from each note ONE crucial word and create a list words. 
I would like to get inspired from that list."

It came up with:
Engagement, Procrastination, Energy, Challenges, Gratitude, Highlights, Console, Focus, Preparation, Speaking, Change, Network, Reflection, Impression, Flight, Streaming, Commenting, Evolution, Moments, Simplicity, Blank, Notes, Visuals, Learning, Benefits, Insights, Writing, Inspiration

For readers of my recent posts, I guess that captures the essence of my notes quite well.

Now I can pick 5 words (or let Chatty pick them for me) and 
write a new post where I combine these words. 

I asked: 
Pick 5 from that list. And give me a pointer how these 5 might connect.

Then:
Can you make a mnemonic from it (maybe from other words)

And it came up with: 
“Every Exciting Road Can Inspire.”

⇢ Every = Engagement: Every meaningful action starts with active participation.
⇢ Exciting = Energy: The excitement reflects the energy you bring to your journey.
⇢ Road = Reflection: The road symbolizes the path you pause to evaluate through reflection.
⇢ Can = Change: Your journey and reflections naturally lead to growth and change.
⇢ Inspire = Inspiration: The result of your efforts, both for yourself and those around you.

Not bad. 

What is ONE word, you pick to guide you today?
