3 clear patterns why people joined my program

(I asked 16 participants why they joined)

Ever wonder what drives people to invest in their learning journey? 

Analyzing Week 1 introductions revealed clear patterns in why participants joined:
â€”â€”â€”
â†’ Knowledge Management & Second Brain topped the list:
"I have notes all over... about eight or nine notebooks"
"My private information management is that I do not find the stuff I need"

â†’ AI Integration & Learning followed closely:
"On my bucket list for this year is I need to learn AI"
"Now we have AI in the middle of everything, which might supercharge connections"

â†’ Productivity & Focus challenges resonated with many:
"I spend so much time on things I need to do that there's no time left for things I love"
"I consume more and implement less"

Most interesting? Many already tried tools like Obsidian but got stuck implementing them effectively.

Our progress so far - Participants have:
â€”â€”â€”
â†’ Set up their basic Obsidian foundation for their Second Brain

â†’ Created a personal PACT and refined it using AI with Langdock

â†’ Received their 4MAT Learning Style assessment with access to coaching sessions

On to Week 2 - where we explore the 4MAT learning cycle and our 12 favorite problems to focus on.

What's your biggest challenge with managing information and learning? Share in the comments.

P.S. - Does such a visualization help?
