Day 2 crushed it

Work with Systematic Curiosity by asking:  
"What is going on here?"  
  
DEFAULT TO CURIOSITY

For each iteration:  
Set your intention and stick to it during the experiment.

A Second Brain, where we externalize our thoughts  
  
â‡¢ enables a dialog with our thoughts

â‡¢ inconsistencies

"from Spark to Remark"  
â†’ move from note-taking to note-making
