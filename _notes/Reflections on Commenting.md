# [[Reflections on Commenting]]

## LinkedIn Post

[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_the-linkedin-paradox-more-engagement-activity-7259097072618950656-9fhw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

The LinkedIn paradox:

â†’ More engagement in less time

Commenting on LinkedIn is challenging for me. 

At my current LinkedIn stage:
â€”â€”â€”
â†’ I answer each comment I receive on my post
~ 50-75 comments to write.
~ 20 seconds per comment

â†’ I provide 20-40 comments for LinkedIn contributors
~ 40 seconds to read a post
~ 30 seconds to comment

In total it is about 1-2 hours for commenting. Daily. 

My three main challenges:
â€”â€”â€”
â†’ Engagement drives reachability âž  comments are important
â†’ my Time per comment is limited
â†’ It does not scale

I developed strategies, that help with commenting efficiency:
â€”â€”â€”

I distinguish comments:
â†’ to support others with visibility
â†’ to engage on content - like feedback, discussions, reflections

With more time per post for the engaging comments. 

I skim read content, to access its main insights quickly. 
When it connects to my 12 favorite problems, I read in more detail

I admit, often I just read 10-20% of a post.
And I get impatient with long text and less structure. 

I know both aren't cool!
But I don't know how to do it better yet. 

I assume I'm not the only active LinkedIn member
who is facing that challenge. Assuming there are many, 
I can tell what content works best for me:

Content that:
â€”â€”â€”
â†’ Is fast to skim and follows a structure 
A story flow. 
Easy language.
Short sentences.
Pleasant formatting. 

â†’ Has supporting visuals like Carousels and Infographics

Content that does not work for me:
â€”â€”â€”
â†’ Videos, where no additional insight is conveyed. 
If I need to wait a minute for something I could have read in 10 seconds, it's a time waster.

â†’ Loooong text, with few, hidden insights. 

What is ONE tip from your commenting strategy?
