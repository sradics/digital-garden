## Text version to make it searchable
+ Mission - the change your company want to bring to the world
+ Company Strategy - the plan you have to bring your company's mission into being
+ Product Strategy - the plan for how product will drive its part of the company strategy
+ Product roadmap - the sequence of features that implement the product strategy
+ Product goals - outcomes of the roadmap that measure product strategy process 

Roadmap and goals are part of product delivery.
Mission and company strategy are driven by company objectives.


# My thoughts
Good visualization of connection between Mission, Company Strategy, Product Strategy, Product Roadmap and Product goals
