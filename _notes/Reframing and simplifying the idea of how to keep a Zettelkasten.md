## Highlights
* simplifying the idea of how to keep a Zettelkasten
* https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/john-lockes-method-for-common-place-books-1685
* Instead ==read about what a commonplace book is== and how that (simpler) form of note taking works.
* https://www.academia.edu/35101285/Creating_a_Commonplace_Book_CPB_.
* Steven Johnson‚Äôs perspective may be interesting to you instead: https://stevenberlinjohnson.com/the-glass-box-and-the-commonplace-book-639b16c4f3bb
* ==collect interesting passages, quotes, and ideas== as you read.
* call these your ‚Äú==fleeting notes==‚Äù
* start building an index of subject headings
* put them on index cards so that they‚Äôre easier to sort through, move around, and re-arrange.
  * **Note**: Actually I can improve this step. Currently I have a lot of Literature notes but I'm not extracting enough condensed notes that I can use a lego building blocks in my Second brain
* keep some index cards that have the references and bibliographies from which your excerpting and note taking comes from.
  * **Note**: I do this in form of MOCs and now started with Literature notes that I link with the resulting permanent notes (or other notes).
* further refine them?
* ==Write them out in your own words. Improve==
* Next you can ==link individual notes together==.
* look back to your subject headings and pull out cards related to broad categories.
* ==ask your slip box a question== and attempt to answer it by consulting your index.
* Find cards related to the topic, pull out those and place them in a useful order to create an outline perhaps using the cross links that already exist.
* Copy the contents into a document and begin editing.
* Do it until you have between 500 and 1000 cards (based on some surveys and anecdotal evidence), and you should begin seeing some serendipitous and intriguing results as you use your system for your writing.
