# [[SAM team rules]]
## LinkedIn Post
[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_your-team-needs-these-4-rules-for-inclusivity-activity-7173226295424720896-jnp_?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

Your team needs these 4 rules  
(for inclusivity, accountability, swift decisions, and radical candor)  
  
Rule 1:  No-one gets lost  
Bring your concerns into the light. If you're drifting, speak up!  
As a team, let's vow to keep an eye out for each other.  
  
Rule 2:  If nobody says anything, everything is fine  
Promotes speaking up for necessary change.  
Extend your decision-making with the 'Disagree and Commit' principle, adding an explicit check.  
  
Rule 3: 🚫 NO GOSSIP  
Let's pledge to speak positively or bring issues directly to those involved. No more talking in the shadows.  
  
Rule 4:  Stop Rumors  
Chase down the source of rumors and clarify anything vague. Get specific.  

Did you implement a similar rule in your team? What would you add?

## Content preparation
When working in teams I recommend to align on ways of working. I recommend the following four team rules as a starting point. 

No-one gets lost
+ bring in yourself when you feel you're getting lost
+ as team member look for others who might get lost

When no one says something, all is good
+ encourages everyone to take accountability to speak up when something needs to change
+ you can extend your decision making with the "Disagree and commit" principle, that adds an explicit check 

No Gossip
+ we don't talk negatively about others behind their backs
+ in a conversation openly name when a gossip zone is entered
+ make a concrete plan how to involve the person, when something needs to be discussed

No Power to rumors
* explore where the rumor originates from
* get specific with blurry phrasing: Who is everyone?

4 simple rules that lead to inclusive behavior, foster accountability, increase speed in decision making and enable radical candor where team members care personally and challenge directly.
