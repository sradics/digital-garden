When working in teams I recommend to align on ways of working. I recommend the following four team rules as a starting point. 

No-one gets lost
+ bring in yourself when you feel you're getting lost
+ as team member look for others who might get lost

When no one says something, all is good
+ encourages everyone to take accountability to speak up when something needs to change
+ you can extend your decision making with the "Disagree and commit" principle, that adds an explicit check 

No Gossip
+ we don't talk negatively about others behind their backs
+ in a conversation openly name when a gossip zone is entered
+ make a concrete plan how to involve the person, when something needs to be discussed

No Power to rumors
* explore where the rumor originates from
* get specific with blurry phrasing: Who is everyone?

4 simple rules that lead to inclusive behavior, foster accountability, increase speed in decision making and enable radical candor where team members care personally and challenge directly.
