## Highlights
you must change to fit the way in which they expect you to do business with them. This has left a world full of troubled, incomplete, or lackluster Scrum implementations. — location: [322](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=322) ^ref-32715

Hence, adopting Kanban is an appropriate way to help a challenged Scrum deployment evolve and adjust to the context in which it is being used. — location: [325](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=325) ^ref-14373

“Is our goal to do Scrum perfectly and be first-class citizens in the worldwide Scrum community? Or is our goal to improve the service delivery of IT work, software development, and new products to our customers?” — location: [328](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=328) ^ref-45969

---
If Scrum hasn’t been working for you, maybe the issue doesn’t lie with you and your ability to follow its strict rules properly. Maybe the truth is that you need a different process solution, uniquely tailored to your situation. Let Kanban help you achieve that, and allow Ajay to guide you in how to do it. — location: [335](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=335) ^ref-14136

---
Be proud of what you’ve achieved so far with Scrum, and embrace the idea that there is so much more you can do in future. — location: [341](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=341) ^ref-14334

If there was one central tenet of Lean, one that no one ever talks about, it would simply be this: You have to pay attention to your project. — location: [344](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=344) ^ref-58133

And creativity requires experimentation and imagination. — location: [351](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=351) ^ref-57833

Therefore, software developers and those drawn to the industry have some key shared characteristics: 1. They are problem solvers. 2. They are inventors. 3. They are craftspeople. 4. They get really angry when they are denied to be 1–3. — location: [352](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=352) ^ref-40195

Software development is a system that is creating other systems. It is intricate. It is social. It is complex. — location: [361](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=361) ^ref-39045

---
Our software products live within social, financial, and digital worlds that we must at least appreciate, if not understand, to craft appropriate code. — location: [365](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=365) ^ref-53513

Are you setting your development teams up with a system that allows them to really see the real-time context of their work? — location: [367](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=367) ^ref-51942

---
Does your system allow your team to notice early when there are problems? Does it allow them to change not just the features, but also your processes? Does it really allow them a sustainable pace (develop a quality product) or are you always trying to improve your velocity (increase utilization)? — location: [369](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=369) ^ref-46148

To steer, you have to pay attention. To pay attention, you need to see your work and reduce distractions. Lean and Kanban will help you do these things, but they are frustrating. — location: [383](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=383) ^ref-55316

Shu (Beginner): The first stage of learning. New learners seek to reproduce a given result by following a set of instructions that are practice focused. They focus on how to perform a task with a basic understanding of the underlying principles. Success in this stage is measured by whether a procedure works and how well the student understands why it works. — location: [546](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=546) ^ref-43461

The student seeks to expand his or her awareness of alternative approaches, learning when an alternative applies and when it breaks down. Success in this stage is measured by how well the student learns to apply adaptive capabilities to varying circumstances. — location: [550](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=550) ^ref-22485

Simple pragmatism and a willingness to experiment are why Scrumban has evolved to become the framework described in this book. — location: [666](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=666) ^ref-56891

As a process framework, Scrum tends to be extremely effective at the team level.2 However, it’s not naturally well suited to whole-system management. — location: [731](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=731) ^ref-44770

Similarly, Scrum doesn’t prescribe specific ways to help measure or manage problems and dysfunctions before they actually manifest themselves. — location: [742](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=742) ^ref-32973

Knowledge work is differentiated from most other types of work by its primary characteristic of “non-routine problem solving that requires a combination of convergent, divergent, and creative thinking” — location: [775](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=775) ^ref-33940

Or perhaps the “bottleneck” lies in a senior team member whose “full” productivity is impeded because 25% of his or her time is devoted to helping other team members. It may be more important to maintain slack for such a senior resource because doing otherwise would actually decrease the productivity of the team as a whole. This dynamic is also not present in a manufacturing setting. — location: [799](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=799) ^ref-31910

Accounting for this variability introduces complexities for which theories and practices in other settings don’t have to account. — location: [811](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=811) ^ref-44252

analytical thinking involves viewing systems as a collection of independent things, causing people to ignore the interactions and dependencies that influence the results of each individual’s actions. — location: [816](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=816) ^ref-27692

then we must recognize the best way to achieve this is to avoid focusing our attention on any specific component of a system in isolation. — location: [822](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=822) ^ref-44617

---
Deming estimated that 94% of business problems are derived from the processes we put in place rather than the people who work within those processes. Improving the system usually eliminates most problems. — location: [830](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=830) ^ref-11091

A system is a set of components with a unifying purpose. Each component has an effect on the whole. — location: [834](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=834) ^ref-5911

---
Each component depends on at least one other component. There are often delayed responses, making cause and effect relationships difficult to perceive. System inputs, processes, and outputs have natural variation. The sum of the output of the components is not equal to the output of the system. Systems have a tendency to move toward disorganization — location: [836](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=836) ^ref-5869

Introducing more than one framework or model is not conducive to maximizing efforts or accelerating through the Shu level of learning. — location: [865](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=865) ^ref-41342

Randomly sample one of the epics. 3. Record the number of stories in your chosen epic. 4. Randomly sample one of the stories. 5. Estimate the number of story points for your chosen story. 6.

counterproductive and create dysfunctional behaviors, such as “manipulating the numbers,” that then become “hidden” systemic influences.

Beware of proxy measurements—numbers that may correlate to a desired result but are not directly representative of it.

You can then compare the lead time for the cards in your “Done” column with the number of check marks for the cards in progress.

such as cross-functional teams working on a small product or subsystem. At this level, work is “thrown over the fence.” There’s no coordinated replenishment of incoming work. The units often serve numerous stakeholders, and trying to coordinate the prioritization efforts of a large volume of stakeholders on a single visual board is perceived as an impossible task. Another common characteristic of units practicing Scrumban at this level is their processing of a large amount of expedited work, especially as stakeholders’ priorities change. — location: [4411](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=4411) ^ref-20212

In other words, we neglect to consider whether the expenditure at issue is “good” (in the sense that the business will ultimately receive more in benefits than it spends) or “bad” (in the sense that the business will receive less in benefits than it spends). Good costs violate the rules of accounting. Yes, they legitimately represent a cost or expense from an accounting standpoint, but they are actually investments.

First, applying “known” distribution patterns is particularly helpful when we don’t have a lot of actual data to work with (such as when we start gathering data or when a particular team or system is relatively new). We can make reasonable forecasts at this stage simply by extrapolating against a predictable pattern as opposed to waiting for more data to be generated. That said, as more data is gathered, we can begin to produce even more accurate assumptions and forecasts by resampling the specific pattern of our actual results. In both stages, the existence of recognized patterns improves the usefulness and precision of our forecasting. — location: [5013](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B010TQKZ5E&location=5013) ^ref-14600

For example, suppose that you have an urn with six balls labeled “1” and four balls labeled “0.” You mix the balls and draw one out, recording the value on the ball. You then replace it in the urn by adding two more balls of the same value. You then repeat the whole process again. This is an example of a nonstationary process.

Options have value. An option is defined as the right, but not the obligation, to take an action in the future. To gain this right we have to incur some upfront cost. Options have a greater value when there are higher degrees of uncertainty associated with the decision tied to them. Options expire.
