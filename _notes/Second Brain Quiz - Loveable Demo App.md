# Second Brain Quiz - Loveable Demo App

A quiz based on insights from learning about Building a Second Brain [[Building a Second Brain - Insights]]. Quiz question were generated with Langdock/Claude.

Used during [Vibe Coding Session](https://www.linkedin.com/events/don-tcodehard-codehappy-lessons7363087317424586752/) 

```
I want to build a Web App that implements a quiz for testing my knowledge on the topic of Building a Second Brain. 

Below I give you 15 quiz question. All with a question, an answer and a resoning for the answer.

The app should work this way:
1) Ask me the 15 questions one-by-one. Each time I reopen the page, start the questions in random order
   
2) After each answer, Show me if I was answering right or wrong and show me the correct answer. Also show the reasoning for the answer
   
I also included a tip for each question. If I want a tip, then show me the tip so that I might find the answer by myself.

## Quiz Questions for Building a Second Brain (Multiple Choice)

### 1. What is the CODE method in Building a Second Brain?

**A)** Create-Organize-Develop-Execute  
**B)** Capture-Organize-Distill-Express  
**C)** Collect-Order-Design-Export  
**D)** Curate-Outline-Draft-Edit

**Answer:** B  
**Hint:** Think of the four main stages of knowledge work: getting it in, organizing it, refining it, and putting it out  
**Reasoning:** CODE is the four-step methodology that forms the core framework of the Second Brain system

### 2. What percentage of a typical knowledge worker's day is spent looking for and consolidating information?

**A)** 16 percent  
**B)** 21 percent  
**C)** 26 percent  
**D)** 31 percent

**Answer:** C  
**Hint:** It's more than a quarter of the workday  
**Reasoning:** This statistic highlights the inefficiency in current information management practices and why a Second Brain is valuable

### 3. According to the PARA method, what are the four main categories for organizing information?

**A)** Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive  
**B)** Plans, Actions, References, Archive  
**C)** Priorities, Activities, Research, Assets  
**D)** Processes, Applications, Records, Artifacts

**Answer:** A  
**Hint:** The acronym spells out a word meaning "alongside" in Greek  
**Reasoning:** PARA is the organizational system that guides sorting ideas according to actionability and goals

### 4. What are the four criteria for deciding what information to capture?

**A)** Important, Urgent, Personal, Actionable  
**B)** Relevant, Timely, Accurate, Complete  
**C)** Does It Inspire Me? Is It Useful? Is It Personal? Is It Surprising?  
**D)** Can I Use It? Will I Remember It? Is It True? Does It Matter?

**Answer:** C  
**Hint:** These questions focus on emotional resonance and personal connection  
**Reasoning:** These four questions help filter information to capture only what truly resonates and has potential value

### 5. What is Progressive Summarization?

**A)** Writing increasingly detailed summaries of your notes over time  
**B)** A technique where you highlight main points, then highlight the main points of those highlights in layers  
**C)** Creating bullet-point summaries that get longer with each revision  
**D)** A method of organizing notes from general to specific topics

**Answer:** B  
**Hint:** Think of peeling an onion - each layer reveals what's most essential  
**Reasoning:** This is the core distillation technique that makes notes more discoverable and actionable

### 6. What is the maximum percentage each layer of highlighting should include in Progressive Summarization?

**A)** 5-10 percent of the previous layer  
**B)** 10-20 percent of the previous layer  
**C)** 20-30 percent of the previous layer  
**D)** 25-35 percent of the previous layer

**Answer:** B  
**Hint:** It's between one-tenth and one-fifth of the previous layer  
**Reasoning:** This constraint prevents over-highlighting and ensures proper distillation of information

### 7. What is the "Hemingway Bridge" technique?

**A)** Writing in short, simple sentences like Hemingway  
**B)** Connecting different ideas with transitional phrases  
**C)** Ending a writing session only when you know what comes next  
**D)** Using dialogue to advance your narrative

**Answer:** C  
**Hint:** It's about setting yourself up for tomorrow's success before you stop today  
**Reasoning:** This technique uses today's momentum to fuel tomorrow's work, making it easier to resume creative tasks

### 8. What are Intermediate Packets?

**A)** Medium-sized files that are too big for quick access but too small for archiving  
**B)** Notes that are partially processed but not yet fully organized  
**C)** Small, concrete units of work that can be shared and built upon  
**D)** Temporary storage for ideas you're not sure about keeping

**Answer:** C  
**Hint:** Think of them as building blocks you can share before the final product is done  
**Reasoning:** These packets allow for incremental progress and frequent feedback, supporting the Express phase of CODE

### 9. What are the four retrieval methods for finding information in your Second Brain?

**A)** Search, Browse, Tag, Serendipity  
**B)** Find, Filter, Follow, Favorite  
**C)** Locate, List, Link, Learn  
**D)** Query, Quick-access, Qualify, Queue

**Answer:** A  
**Hint:** The last method involves happy accidents and unexpected discoveries  
**Reasoning:** These four methods provide different ways to rediscover information based on different contexts and needs

### 10. What is the definition of a "knowledge building block"?

**A)** A standardized format for storing all your notes  
**B)** A note that stands on its own with intrinsic value but can be combined with others  
**C)** The basic unit of measurement for knowledge work productivity  
**D)** A template for creating consistent note structures

**Answer:** B  
**Hint:** Like LEGO blocks - valuable alone but more powerful when combined  
**Reasoning:** This concept explains how individual notes can be assembled into larger creative works

### 11. What are the two main modes of creative work described in the book?

**A)** Analysis and Synthesis  
**B)** Research and Writing  
**C)** Divergence and Convergence  
**D)** Planning and Execution

**Answer:** C  
**Hint:** One spreads out to explore possibilities, the other narrows down to create focus  
**Reasoning:** Divergence opens possibilities and gathers ideas, while convergence eliminates options and creates focused output

### 12. What should you NOT keep in your Second Brain?

**A)** Personal reflections and journal entries  
**B)** Sensitive information, special format files, very large files, or collaboratively edited documents  
**C)** Ideas that seem incomplete or half-formed  
**D)** Information from sources you don't completely trust

**Answer:** B  
**Hint:** Think about what needs special security, special software, or special collaboration tools  
**Reasoning:** These types of content are better handled by dedicated, specialized applications

### 13. What is the "Archipelago of Ideas" technique?

**A)** Organizing notes by geographic or spatial relationships  
**B)** Creating island-like clusters of related concepts  
**C)** A method that separates selecting ideas from arranging them into logical flow  
**D)** Building bridges between unrelated topics

**Answer:** C  
**Hint:** Like island-hopping, you first choose your destinations, then plan your route  
**Reasoning:** This technique helps overcome the brain's difficulty in performing selection and sequencing simultaneously

### 14. What percentage of the time are knowledge workers able to find the information they're looking for?

**A)** 46 percent  
**B)** 51 percent  
**C)** 56 percent  
**D)** 61 percent

**Answer:** C  
**Hint:** It's just over half the time - barely better than a coin flip  
**Reasoning:** This low success rate demonstrates the need for better personal knowledge management systems

### 15. What is the ultimate purpose of building a Second Brain according to the document?

**A)** To become more knowledgeable and well-informed  
**B)** To support taking action and creating output, not just collecting information  
**C)** To organize all your digital files and documents  
**D)** To improve your memory and recall abilities

**Answer:** B  
**Hint:** It's not about hoarding knowledge - it's about using it to make things happen  
**Reasoning:** The system exists to help you move projects forward and create value, not just to store information
