# Obsidian Second Brain Setup Instructions - V1.0.0

It takes you 7 simple steps, doable in 5 minutes to open your Obsidian-Second Brain. I'll outline the 7 steps here for you. 

1) Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and please follow the installation instructions described by the Obsidian team.

2) Download your Second-Brain template:

3) Unpack to a folder, where you can find it in the next step again.
(on Mac I e.g. unpacked in folder /Users/sebastiankamilli/Documents/MySecondBrain-1.0.0)
