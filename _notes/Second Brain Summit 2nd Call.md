Tiago Forte invented the Second Brain approach. 

And now he calls his crowd to LA. I followed.

And he did a great job this week.

When he gave a detailed summit outline.

I'm super excited. 

â†’ So many great sessions to choose from

â†’ So many great speakers, my Heroes

â†’ So many great people to meet

And I've booked my sessions already

â†’ I'll explore linking your thinking

â†’ I'll learn about harnessing my digital brain

â†’ I'll dive into mental models for external brains

Sounds nerdy? It is. 
Proud to be on of the Nerds.

Btw - How often did I mention "Brain"?

First time in LA. What is ONE thing I must not miss?
