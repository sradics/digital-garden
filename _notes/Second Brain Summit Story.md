You can learn a lot in your career.  
  
â‡¢ But can you actually use it?  
  
Do you sometimes face that too?  
  
â†’ Youâ€™ve given that presentation  
â†’ Learned that topic  
â†’ Read that book  
  
But when itâ€™s time to use it  
  
â†’ You search everywhere  
â†’ Things are scattered  
â†’ Most is gone  
  
I have learned so much in my career. Yet, I couldnâ€™t retrieve my learnings fast. What a mess!  
  
I was not ready to apply when I needed to.  
  
â†’ We lose momentum  
â†’ We miss opportunities  
â†’ We invested lifetime first - to forget next?  
  
Everything changed when a colleague showed me his system.  
He organized his notes and connected his thoughts.  
  
I discovered the Second Brain approach by Tiago Forte.  
  
Three years later, I organize my knowledge for actionability.  
  
A high-speed knowledge processing system.  
A FREE HIGHWAY instead of a blocked road.  
  
Was it easy to put in place?  
  
Not at all.  
â‡¢ I'm a pioneer in this field, an early adopter.  
â‡¢ I went through many learning cycles.  
â‡¢ Improved step by step.  
  
âž  Then you become a Second Brain master.  
  
Itâ€™s my core approach to learn, recall, and apply knowledge with IMPACT.  
  
Cheesy to say, but it changed my life.  
  
Time to meet my heroes.  
Time to meet the momentum.  
  
Next week, I'll join the [hashtag#secondbrainsummit](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=secondbrainsummit&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7245674286391115776) in LA.  
  
The first in-person summit where hundreds of pioneers will meet.  
â†’ A MOVEMENT  
  
Looking forward to meeting [Tiago Forte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiagoforte/), [Billy Broas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billybroas/), Nick Milo, [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alecunff/), Soehnke Ahrens, Steve Johnson, [Isabella Masucci](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabella-masucci-79418080/), Rachel Woods, Khe Hy, and so many more.  
  
Use me as your delegate.  
What is ONE question I should bring forward for you?
