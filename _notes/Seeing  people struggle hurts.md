# [[Seeing  people struggle hurts]]

The most undervalued resource isn't money.  
  
â†’ It's this (and you're wasting it daily):  

Yesterday's post by [Luke Matthews](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukematthws/) deeply moved me  
(You can find it here: [https://lnkd.in/enCBvM7r](https://lnkd.in/enCBvM7r))  
  
I've been following Luke's writing for quite some time. I appreciate his real talk and his unique, provocative style. I was particularly impressed by his efforts to elevate writing with AI support to the next level.  

Luke's approach to promoting his AI course is noteworthy:  
â†’ Through engaging newsletter teasers  
â†’ By providing free examples that offer immediate value  
â†’ By consistently showing up on LinkedIn and delivering value  
  
I was almost ready to join his AI writing course but decided to hold back. I need to manage my investments carefully, and I feel confident in my ability to work with AI and carve my own path.  
  
I would never have guessed that there is a struggle for Luke.  
  
His struggle goes deep.  
It moves me, also because his struggle mirrors my own.  
  
I also invest heavily in my daily LinkedIn presence to:  
  
â†’ Support you in Learning how to Learn  
â†’ Establish and grow my Personal Brand  
â†’ Create my path to becoming a successful Solopreneur  
  
Learning how to Learn as a topic is a VITAMIN,  
but it is NOT a PAINKILLER. (Similar to Luke's writing with AI.)  
  
It solves the problem of saving time.  
Actually the most scarce resource we have.  
But at the same time the most undervalued resource.  
  
People often realize they've wasted time  
only when they're nearing the end of their lives.  
  
Shortly before death.  
The intangible becomes tangible, suddenly.  
  
Is it worth delaying the investment in real change?  
  
Is time-saving and building the foundation for future career not important enough to cut through the noise of short-term dopamine and adrenaline hits?  
  
This is quite an interesting challenge.  
  
As Morpheus said in The Matrix,  
  
"You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland,  
and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes."  
  
We need to choose the red pillâ€”embracing the challenge of the unknown and the potential for profound change. Instead, we mainly choose the blue pill.  
  
Luke, I'm thinking of you.  
Together, we will find a way to convey our message effectively.  
  
We will make the vitamin so vital that it becomes urgent to prevent running out of it.  

â€”â€”â€”  
P.S.  
I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease
