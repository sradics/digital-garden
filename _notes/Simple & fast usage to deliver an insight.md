# Simple & fast usage to deliver an insight

Today morning a colleague asked me about a topic they usually brainstorm on. I remembered it's not a good approach, and was asked where I knew this from.

I quickly found *Why brainstorming fails* in my Digital Garden, scanned the insights and shared with my colleague.

When I noticed that other sources were missing from my knowledge, I immediately took steps to extend it by finding concrete sources from the book I was referring to and also from the workshops I already applied a different format.
