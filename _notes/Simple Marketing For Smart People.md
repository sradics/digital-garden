I'm hooked by 📖 Simple Marketing for Smart People  
(Next on your reading list?)  
  
I just started "Simple Marketing for Smart People" by [Billy Broas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billybroas/) and [Tiago Forte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiagoforte/). Here’s why I’m hooked after reading just one-third of it:  
  
Favorite quotes:  
———  
→ "What does my prospect need to believe in order to buy?"  
  
→ "all this marketing complexity can too easily rob your attention from what matters most: your core marketing message"  
(the central argument for why someone should choose your product or service)  
  
→ "You must meet your customers where they are and walk the journey with them to buying your product."  
  
→ "when you keep things simple, you free up the time, attention, and headspace to invest in what matters most."  
  
Great River metaphor and distinction between  
Upstream, Midstream and Downstream areas for marketing.  
  
3 smart person mistakes about marketing:  
———  
1️⃣ Thinking the Product Will Sell Itself  
2️⃣ Incorrect Assumptions about Success  
3️⃣ Seeing Marketing as Inherently Bad  
  
3 step belief building  
———  
1️⃣ Identify your prospects’ current beliefs  
2️⃣ Identify the beliefs required for the purchase to be obvious  
3️⃣ Create the marketing content that builds those required beliefs  
  
Why I'm hooked reading further:  
→ Great storytelling  
→ Tons of insights and derived many follow ups  
→ Love the perspective switches between Tiago and Billy  
→ They got me - the content connects to my struggles with Marketing
