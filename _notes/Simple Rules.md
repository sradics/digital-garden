The rules of triage are an excellent example of what we call simple rules, the rules of thumb that people and organizations use to make decisions and take action quickly and efficiently. — location: [85](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=85) ^ref-17318

---
Simple rules allow people to act without having to stop and rethink every decision. — location: [92](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=92) ^ref-51260

---
First, they confer the flexibility to pursue new opportunities while maintaining some consistency. Second, they can produce better decisions. When information is limited and time is short, simple rules make it fast and easy for people, organizations, and governments to make sound choices. They can even outperform complicated decision-making approaches in some situations. Finally, simple rules allow the members of a community to synchronize — location: [102](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=102) ^ref-12117

Second, simple rules are tailored to the person or organization using them. — location: [110](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=110) ^ref-51224

---
Third, simple rules apply to a well-defined activity or decision, — location: [112](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=112) ^ref-2326

---
Rules that cover multiple activities or choices end up as vague platitudes, such as “Do your best” and “Focus on customers.” — location: [113](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=113) ^ref-31894

---
Finally, simple rules provide clear guidance while conferring the latitude to exercise discretion. — location: [113](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=113) ^ref-54837

The parts of a complex system can interact with one another in many different ways, which quickly overwhelms our ability to envision all possible outcomes. — location: [190](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=190) ^ref-9296

---
Complicated solutions can overwhelm people, thereby increasing the odds that they will stop following the rules. — location: [198](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=198) ^ref-57488

---
One of our most surprising and important findings is that simple rules are not immutable—they can evolve in light of new evidence, shifting objectives, and changed conditions. — location: [216](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=216) ^ref-15874

Keeping the number of rules to a handful forces you to focus on what matters most. — location: [289](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=289) ^ref-34101

---
simple rules are tailored to the situations of the particular people who will use them, versus one-size-fits-all rules that apply to everyone. — location: [294](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=294) ^ref-2855

The resulting flexibility makes it easier to adapt to changing circumstances and seize fleeting opportunities. — location: [425](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=425) ^ref-1035

---
Simple rules enable people to make quick, reasonably accurate decisions that require less effort than more complicated approaches. — location: [428](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=428) ^ref-26903

analytically complicated and information-intensive approaches even when there is ample time and information to make a decision. — location: [438](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=438) ^ref-58886

---
This is especially true in situations when the links between cause and effect are poorly understood, when important variables are highly correlated, when a few factors matter most, and when a gap exists between knowing what to do and actually doing — location: [439](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=439) ^ref-47152

Fitting a model too closely to historical data hardwires error into the model, which is known as overfitting. — location: [454](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=454) ^ref-10661

---
because big data mixed with little theory is a recipe for overfitting. — location: [456](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=456) ^ref-62964

---
you crunch a lot of numbers without a good theory, you will find correlations—the problem is, they may be spurious. — location: [460](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=460) ^ref-48461

Psychologists have found, however, that people tend to overweigh peripheral variables at the expense of critical ones when they try to take all factors into account. — location: [477](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=477) ^ref-33215

---
Simple rules minimize the risk of overweighing peripheral considerations by focusing on the criteria most crucial for making good decisions. — location: [484](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=484) ^ref-40000

---
Simple rules also make it more likely that people will act on their decisions, — location: [485](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=485) ^ref-4836

---
they also keep them from abandoning a decision once they have made — location: [494](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=494) ^ref-13890

Simplicity is even more important when people are tired, stressed, or otherwise cognitively impaired. — location: [497](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=497) ^ref-18261

---
we deploy willpower on one decision, we have less self-control available for our next decision. — location: [499](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=499) ^ref-54354

No single bee visits all the sites to make direct comparisons, nor does the queen weigh the options and make the final call. Instead, all of the bees collectively follow the rules that allow them to gather disparate pieces of information, process them as a group, evaluate options, and decide. — location: [551](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=551) ^ref-64546

When two sophisticated parties, like Samsung and Google, for example, forge a very specific technology alliance, it makes sense that they rely on a detailed contract rather than simple rules. When many parties must work together, simple trumps complex. — location: [596](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=596) ^ref-61619

---
First, they allow for flexibility in the pursuit of new opportunities, avoiding the rigidity of too many rules and the chaos of none at all. They are particularly effective when the situation is in flux, flexibility trumps consistency, and the benefits of seizing opportunities exceed the cost of making mistakes. Second, simple rules can produce decisions that match or outperform more sophisticated decision models across a wide variety of possible scenarios, and do so quickly, with limited data requirements, and when cause and effect are imperfectly understood. Their simplicity, — location: [601](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=601) ^ref-34617

Boundary rules also help you to pick which opportunities to pursue and which to reject when faced with a large number of alternatives. — location: [645](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=645) ^ref-50448

---
The above example illustrates an important benefit of boundary rules—they narrow down the alternatives, — location: [671](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=671) ^ref-19501

depression is a shape-shifting disease that can be fiendishly difficult to diagnose because it has so many manifestations. Symptoms can be as subtle and varied as overeating (or undereating), persistent aches and pains, oversleeping (or undersleeping), digestive problems, and chronic indecisiveness. — location: [705](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=705) ^ref-24697

key to getting unstuck from old rules is, however, to avoid this tendency to never take the blame. — location: [2764](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7GTSY&location=2764) ^ref-37088

There are situations, however, when it is unwise to wait passively for the next big change.

The people who benefit from complexity pose a second obstacle to simplicity.
