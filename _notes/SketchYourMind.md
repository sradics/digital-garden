Text-heavy notes are killing your creativity.

â†’ This book just changed how I think about thinking

â€”â€”â€”

You've been trained to capture everything in words.

Bullet points. Paragraphs. Linear lists.

But here's what's happening:

Your brain thinks in images, connections, and spatial relationships.

Yet your notes look like a legal document.

â€”â€”â€”

The irony kills me:

We have the most visual brains in human history.

But our knowledge systems are stuck in the typewriter age.

â€”â€”â€”

"Sketch your Mind" by Zsolt VicziÃ¡n just opened a door I didn't know existed.

â†’ Notes become sketches 
â†’ Ideas get visually linked  
â†’ Everything is movable, revisitable, alive

This isn't about becoming an artist.

It's about returning to how your brain naturally works.

â€”â€”â€”

I've been following Zsolt's work for years.

He created Excalidraw - my go-to tool for visual thinking in Obsidian.

I thought I was using it well for presentations and workshops.

I was wrong.

The book revealed I was barely scratching the surface.

â€”â€”â€”

Here's what shifted for me:

Instead of forcing visual thinking into text boxes, I'm building a 4D knowledge system.

â†’ Sketches live next to text 
â†’ Connections become visible 
â†’ Ideas have spatial relationships 
â†’ Everything links and flows

It's like upgrading from a filing cabinet to a living ecosystem.

â€”â€”â€”

Yes, there's a learning curve.

But with AI helping me sketch faster and Zsolt's frameworks guiding the way, 
I'm excited to expand beyond text-heavy thinking.

Your visual intuition is waiting. It's time to let it out.

â€”â€”â€”

What knowledge could you unlock if your notes looked more like your thoughts?

â€”â€”â€”

P.S. 
If you're using Obsidian, the Excalidraw plugin is a game-changer. 
If you're not using Obsidian yet... we need to talk.
