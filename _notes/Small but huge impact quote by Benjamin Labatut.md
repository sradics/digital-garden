# Small but huge impact quote by Benjamin Labatut
Something very small, so tiny and insignificant in its origin, can nonetheless open up a new and radiant perspective, because through it a higher order of being is trying to express itself.

These unlikely happenings could be hidden all around us, lying in wait on the border of our awareness, or floating quietly amid the sea of information that we frown in, each one bearing the potential to bloom and irradiate, prying apart the floorboards of this world to show us what lies beneath.

â€” Benjamin Labatut
