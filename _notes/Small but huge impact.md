  Small insights can lead to big changes.  
  
â†’ Start connecting your thoughts today.  

The quote by Benjamin Labatut was the perfect intro at the [hashtag#secondbrainsummit](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=secondbrainsummit&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7249660131800416256)  
  
A bridge to a main theme:Â Networked Thinking.  
  
"Something very small, so tiny and insignificant in its origin, can nonetheless open up a new and radiant perspective"  
  
It is about actively working with information.  
  
Among many, two approaches stand out:  
  
â†’ Building a Second Brain by [Tiago Forte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiagoforte/)  
â†’ Linking Your Thinking by Nick Milo  
  
I have worked for more than 3 years with a blend of both approaches.  
It changed my life.  
It can change yours too.  
  
â†’ You become more aware  
â†’ You compound your knowledge  
â†’ You find joy in connecting your dots  
  
"Unlikely happenings could be hidden all around us"  
"Floating quietly amid the sea of information"  
  
When we  
  
â†’ make notes and connect ideas  
â†’ reflect on their meaning  
â†’ add our context  
  
I recommend switching to a method that encourages  
m a k i n gÂ Â n o t e s  
rather than only consuming information.  
  
"To show us what lies beneath"  
  
âž  You reach a higher level of understanding  
âž  You find joy when thoughts emerge  
âž  You can make a difference  
  
You don't yet know how to start?  
Let's talk.  
  
When was your last moment a tiny insight appeared and changed your perception?  
  
Did you make a note?
