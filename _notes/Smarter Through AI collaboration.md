Stop outsourcing your brain to AI

â†’ Are you creating AI dependency or partnership?

I remember that exact moment vividly.

Sitting in my home office at 5 AM, surrounded by crumpled notes and empty coffee cups. The cursor blinked mockingly at me as I cycled through the same mediocre writing  for the hundredth time.

Then something shifted. Instead of asking "What should this headline say?" I found myself thinking: "What if I taught AI to think like me about headlines?"

That single question changed everything.

Here's the contradiction most people miss: 
The smarter you make AI, the smarter you become.

Are you treating AI like a magic black box?
â€”â€”â€” Type in a request, get an output, move on. 

But every time you outsource thinking without teaching your expertise, you're creating dependency that makes you weaker, not stronger.

This insight flips the script:
â€”â€”â€”
Creating AI assistants forces you to externalize your expertise. 
And externalization is where real learning happens.

When I built that headline assistant, I had to dig deep into what I actually knew about effective headlines. Patterns I'd been following unconsciously suddenly became conscious frameworks.

This wasn't just prompt engineering. 
This was knowledge archaeology.

May I introduce my current AI team:
â€”â€”â€”
â†’ "Data" - My program director 
(47 conversations, 317 messages in 45 days)

â†’ "Hooky" - My writing coach 
(115 conversations, 323 messages)  

â†’ "Five" - My messaging strategist
(25 conversations, 123 messages)

(+37 more)

Each assistant makes me better at what I do while amplifying my expertise.

Your 10-minute first step:
â€”â€”â€”
1. Pick one task you repeat weekly
2. Write down everything you know about doing it well
3. Create a basic AI assistant with these insights
4. Use it once
5. Iterate

This way you're not just building AI toolsâ€”you're building thinking partners.

Your expertise deserves better than being trapped in your head. With creating your AI assistants you escape that trap.
