🚀 Smashed My January Exercise Goals: Unleash the Power of Habit Stacking (discover my combination of 4 habit building approaches)  
  
Ever wondered how to supercharge your exercise routine? In January, I hit a personal record - 3000 minutes of Peloton training!  
  
💪 Every day started with a blend of 15' meditation, 25' yoga, 5' strength, and 60-120' cycling, kick-starting my day with a sense of accomplishment 🎯  
  
✪ Weekends? Extra training time! 📈  
✪ Push-ups? Started the year with 11, now I'm at 31 (and 17 in the second round) 💪  
  
Observing plateaus and adaptation in my body has been fascinating - usually, it takes around 2 days for the body to adapt. 🧠  
  
And here's how I build my habits - I follow 4 principles:  
✪ 30-for-30 approach: At least 30 minutes of exercise for 30 consecutive days. For me, it's at least 90 minutes each day! 🏋️‍♂️  
  
✪ The 2-day rule: Never skip more than one day in a row when building a habit. If I can't cycle, I switch it up - but physical activity is a must! 🏃‍♂️  
  
✪ Habit stacking: Attach a new habit to an existing routine. For instance, I do push-ups after yoga and combine cycling with thinking about topics I read or analyzed before 🧘‍♂️🚴‍♂️  
  
✪ Minimum Viable Progress: Push my push-ups to the limits each day. Inspired by Goggins, I earn my mental cookies each day. It's a love-hate relationship 😅  
  
So, what's your exercise routine? How do you build your habits? Let's share and learn together! 🌱🌍

## Content preparation
+ in January I reached the first time ever 3000 minutes Peloton training per month
+ done with a stack of 10-15' meditation,25' yoga, 5' strength, 60-120' cycling
+ embedded in my morning routine to start in the day energized with a sense of accomplishment
+ on weekends I usually extend training
+ From starting with 11 push-ups at start at the year I'm now at 31 push-ups, second round 17 
+ It is interesting to watch the plateaus and that is takes around 2 days for the body to adapt

4 components I apply for my habit building
+ 30-for-30 approach, means to do at least 30 minutes of exercise in 30 consecutive days. What I did now with at least 90 minutes each day
+ followed the 2 day rule, to not skip more than one day in a row when building a new habit. When I can' cycle I have a replacement like walking. But pushed myself to have physical activity each day
+ I apply habit stacking what means to attach a new habit to an existing routine. This way I embedded the push-ups after Yoga and I combine my cycling with thinking about topics I read or analyzed before, to leverage diffused mode learning. 
+ I aim for Minimum Viable Progress each day. I can best feel that with push-ups. Inspired by Goggins I earn my mental cookies each day, by pushing it to the limits. I hate it and I love it afterwards.
