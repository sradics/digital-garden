 They got: 9 AI assistants. 8 weeks. 

â†’ Result: One big shift.

In our Learning Ecosystem cohort#01,  participants didn't just learn about AI enhanced work â€” they built their own intelligent guides.

The breakthrough? Moving from theory to real action.

Each session, participants left with a custom assistant that guides them to apply what they learned. But here's what makes this different: they get the full instructions too. No black boxes. No knowledge islands.

They learn to tune, adapt, and build their own Learning Ecosystem step by step. These 9 AI assistants are one crucial building block.

The 9 assistants that emerged:
â€”â€”â€”
â†’ PACT assistant
Create and refine your personal action commitments

â†’ 4MAT Learning Style assistant
Discover and apply your optimal learning approach

â†’ 12 Favorite Problem assistant
Identify your core focus areas

â†’ Second Brain assistant
Build your external thinking system

â†’ Building Block assistant
Create future-proof knowledge assets

â†’ Book.To.Action assistant
Transform (book) insights into implementation

â†’ What wants to be expressed assistant
Bridge knowledge to action and sharing

â†’ Idea Explorer assistant
Examine concepts from 17 different perspectives

â†’ Dr. Throughput assistant
Optimize workflows with AI integration

This is what I call highly immersive learning: 
building the tools while learning the principles.

Which assistant would you build first?

â€”â€”â€”
Cohort 02 start in July.
