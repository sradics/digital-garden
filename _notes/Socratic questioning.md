# Socratic questioning


> [!quote]
> Questions are the best type of teacher because they stimulate critical thinking [^4]

Based on disciplined, thoughtful dialog. To examine ideas logically and determine validity.

To promote independent thinking.
To weed out the good options from the bad.

Show enthusiasm and let's one experience the groups reality - their inspirations, interests, difficulties, goals.

### Types of Socratic questions

> [!tip]
> Ask *What* and *How* based questions instead of *Why*
(Why questions are interpreted as a threat. And we leave critical thinking when we feel attacked.)

#### Clarification questions

+ What do you mean by?
+ Could you put that another way?
+ What do you think is the main issue?
+ Can you give an example?

#### Questions about an initial question or issue

+ Why is this question important?
+ Does this question lead to other important issues and questions?

#### Probing Assumption questions

+ Why would someone make this assumption?
+ What is *person* assuming?
+ Do I understand you correctly?  (to bring in own assumptions)

#### Reason and evidence questions

+ What would be an example?
+ Why do you think this is true? What led you to that belief?
+ What other information do we need? Have?
+ Could you explain your reason?
+ Is there a reason to doubt that evidence?

#### Origin and source questions

+ Where does that idea come from?
+ What influenced your opinion?
+ What caused you feel that way?

#### Implication and consequence questions

+ What effect would that have?
+ Could that happen?
+ What is an alternative?
+ What are you implying by that?
+ What else would happen as a result?

#### Viewpoint questions

+ How would others respond?
+ How would you answer the objection that *person/group* would make?
+ What would someone who believed *other belief* think?
+ What is an alternative?
+ How are *others* ideas alike? Different?
