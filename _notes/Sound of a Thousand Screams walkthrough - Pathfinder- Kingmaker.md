# Sound of a Thousand Screams walkthrough - Pathfinder- Kingmaker

## Metadata

* URL: [http://www.paulgraham.com/fh.html](http://www.paulgraham.com/fh.html)

## Highlights

* Anders Ericsson studied the ==differences between experts and novices== and summarized what he learned in the book [[Peak - Anders Ericsson Robert Pool]].
* Ericsson argues that ==when it comes to developing a skill, doing the skill over and over again only helps to improve your skill until it becomes automatic. After that, if you want to improve, you need to focus on deliberate practice==.

## A deliberate practice

* It involves ==breaking a skill into its component steps==.
* It ==requires focusâ€”your full attention==. 
* It ==requires feedback==. 
* It ==requires getting outside your comfort zone==.
