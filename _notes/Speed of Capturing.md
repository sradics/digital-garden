## Content preparation
I often have ideas and extending thoughts when I'm on my way. And I found it crucial to capture these ideas for later to develop such ideas further. Often these sparks are important and get lost when context changes. And I observed myself being disappointed when I cannot recap that small lightbulb moment. 

And I observed that for me it is important to have a lightweight inflow of captured thoughts to my Second Brain center that I maintain in Obsidian. For all Online information I already use Matter and with its automated import to Obsidian this work super well already (details on my capturing with Matter: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_secondbrain-efficiency-productivity-activity-7154820795981053952-U1Tg?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

Some practice for rapid capture when I'm on the go that work well for me are:

+ Take a voice note to my mobile. I use the App JustPressRecord for that - it allows taking a voice note and supports with an immediate transcription. 
+ Add a note to Obsidian on my Mobile - with the benefit of already have a Markdown Format
+ Take a picture and combine with a note, also in Obsidian

To have a more lightweight import of further information from my Mobile too I developed my first super simple Obsidian Plugin. It imports data from a Google Drive Folder to my Obsidian and converts text information to Markdown Files and Binary Files to Markdown Files with and included attachments. 

Benefits:
+ I can share captures asynchronously to the G-Drive folder
+ I capture to Obsidian when I'm on my Laptop
+ I save several steps of converting notes. Makes it easier and less prone to losing the idea along the way.

I will experiment further with ChatGPT and automatically exporting information, as this would allow to reduce my App stack further and simplify capturing.
