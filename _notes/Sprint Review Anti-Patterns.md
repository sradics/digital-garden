## Highlights
* Moreover, how did the previous Sprint contribute to our Scrum team’s mission?
* ==Selfish PO==: Product Owners present “their” accomplishments to the stakeholders.
* ==“Acceptance” by the PO==: The Product Owner uses the Sprint Review to “accept” Product Backlog items that
* ==Unapproachable PO:== The Product Owner is not accepting feedback from stakeholders or the Developers.
* ==Death by PowerPoint:== Participants of the Sprint Review are bored to death by PowerPoint.
* Sprint Review is “show, don’t tell,” or even better: let the stakeholders drive the discovery.
* Instead, ==make it interesting enough that everyone wants to participate.==
* ==Undone is the new “done:”== More often than not, the Developers show work items that are not “done.”
* ==There is no Sprint Review, as the Developers did not meet the Sprint Goal.== (A rookie mistake. Particularly in such a situation, a Sprint Review is necessary to create transparency with stakeholders and inspect the Increments that the Developers nevertheless managed to accomplish.)
* Tell a compelling story at the beginning of the Sprint review on the task the Scrum team ventured out to accomplish and engage the stakeholders with that narrative.
* ==No stakeholders:== Stakeholders do not attend the Sprint Review.
* To my experience, you need to “sell” the event within the organization, at least at the beginning of using Scrum.)
* ==No customers present:== External stakeholders—also known as customers—do not attend the Sprint Review.
* ==Passive stakeholders:== The stakeholders are passive and unengaged.
