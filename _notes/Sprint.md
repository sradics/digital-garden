## Highlights
First, there was time to develop ideas independently, unlike the shouting and pitching in a group brainstorm. But there wasn’t too much time. Looming deadlines forced me to focus. — location: [83](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=83) ^ref-25010

---
and completely focused on one question: How should their robot behave around humans? — location: [174](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=174) ^ref-10408

---
Together, we created a map to identify the biggest risks. — location: [179](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=179) ^ref-54996

---
On Monday, you’ll map out the problem and pick an important place to focus. On Tuesday, you’ll sketch competing solutions on paper. On Wednesday, you’ll make difficult decisions and turn your ideas into a testable hypothesis. On Thursday, you’ll hammer out a realistic prototype. And on Friday, you’ll test it with real live humans. — location: [256](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=256) ^ref-31717

---
Danny Ocean: someone with authority to make decisions. That person is the Decider, a role so important we went ahead and capitalized it. The Decider is the official decision-maker for the project. — location: [392](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=392) ^ref-1720

---
These Deciders generally understand the problem in depth, and they often have strong opinions and criteria to help find the right solution. — location: [395](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=395) ^ref-58346

---
Get a Decider (or two) The Decider must be involved in the sprint. If you, dear reader, are the Decider, clear your schedule and get in the room. — location: [408](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=408) ^ref-60703

---
And if your Decider doesn’t believe the sprint to be worthwhile? If she won’t even stop by for a cameo? Hold up! That’s a giant red flag. You might have the wrong project. — location: [427](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=427) ^ref-30043

---
We’ve found the ideal size for a sprint to be seven people or fewer. — location: [434](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=434) ^ref-42307

You’ll start at 10 a.m. and end at 5 p.m., with an hour-long lunch in between. — location: [516](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=516) ^ref-34753

And more time to work made us more attached to our ideas and, in turn, less willing to learn from our colleagues or our customers. — location: [527](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=527) ^ref-39774

It’s okay to check your device during a break. 2.  It’s okay to leave the room to check your device. At any time. No judgment. Take a call, check an email, tweet a Tweet, whatever – just take it outside. — location: [541](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=541) ^ref-28296

But if you don’t first slow down, share what you know, and prioritize, you could end up wasting time and effort on the wrong part of the problem. — location: [635](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=635) ^ref-31097

If you could jump ahead to the end of your sprint, what questions would be answered? If you went six months or a year further into the future, what would have improved about your business as a result of this project? — location: [643](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=643) ^ref-43671

Imagine you’ve gone forward in time one year, and your project was a disaster. What caused it to fail? How did your goal go wrong? — location: [661](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=661) ^ref-56233

---
Just like the goal, these questions guide the solutions and decisions throughout the sprint. — location: [667](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=667) ^ref-12252

What questions do we want to answer in this sprint? •  To meet our long-term goal, what has to be true? — location: [671](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=671) ^ref-43803

Imagine we travel into the future and our project failed. What might have caused that? — location: [672](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=672) ^ref-57506

An important part of this exercise is rephrasing assumptions and obstacles into questions. — location: [673](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=673) ^ref-64902

To reach new customers, what has to be true? A:  They have to trust our expertise. Q: How can we phrase that as a question? A: Will customers trust our expertise? — location: [676](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=676) ^ref-36613

Each map is customer-centric, with a list of key actors on the left. — location: [757](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=757) ^ref-11632

---
1. List the actors (on the left) The “actors” are all the important characters in your story. Most often, they’re different kinds of customers. — location: [763](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=763) ^ref-60920

2. Write the ending (on the right) — location: [766](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=766) ^ref-65177

---
Strategy Start by talking to the Decider. If the Decider is not going to be in the sprint the whole time, be sure she joins you on Monday afternoon. Some useful questions to ask: “What will make this project a success?” “What’s our unique advantage or opportunity?” “What’s the biggest — location: [817](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=817) ^ref-343

---
We frequently talk with two, three, or four “how things work” experts to help us understand how everything fits together. — location: [826](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=826) ^ref-53685

---
Previous Efforts Often, someone on the team has already thought about the problem in detail. — location: [828](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=828) ^ref-29249

---
Ask the Experts Allow half an hour for each conversation, — location: [835](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=835) ^ref-50982

---
4. Ask questions — location: [840](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=840) ^ref-41425

---
appreciate how the open-ended, optimistic phrasing forced us to look for opportunities and challenges, — location: [868](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=868) ^ref-19059

---
First, Jake, as the sprint’s Facilitator, began the interview by asking Bobby about the map on the whiteboard. — location: [900](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=900) ^ref-18645

---
“Remind us . . .” is useful, because most interviews include content the team has heard before, at some point or another. — location: [902](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=902) ^ref-59292

---
After a look back over your long-term goal, your sprint questions, your map, and the notes you took this afternoon, your team will choose one specific target for the rest of your sprint’s efforts. — location: [946](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=946) ^ref-14869

---
After interviewing the experts and organizing your notes, the most important part of your project — location: [965](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=965) ^ref-60193

---
should jump right out of your map, almost like a crack in the earth. — location: [966](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=966) ^ref-25723

---
Your final task on Monday is to choose a target for your sprint. — location: [966](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=966) ^ref-916

---
Who is the most important customer, and what’s the critical moment of that customer’s experience? The rest of the sprint will flow from this decision. — location: [967](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=967) ^ref-15664

---
The Decider needs to choose one target customer and one target event on the map. — location: [1005](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=1005) ^ref-17988

We like to take a ten-minute break every sixty to ninety minutes, since that’s about as long as anyone can stay focused on one task or exercise. — location: [1046](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=1046) ^ref-35909

job as Facilitator to call on the Decider. — location: [1059](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=1059) ^ref-8491

---
Your team will take turns giving three-minute tours of their favorite solutions: — location: [1084](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=1084) ^ref-56480

---
Time and time again, the ideas that spark the best solutions come from similar problems in different environments. — location: [1086](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=1086) ^ref-16784

---
Sometimes, the best way to broaden your search is to look inside your own organization. — location: [1095](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=1095) ^ref-34683

---
Ask everyone on your team to come up with a list of products or services to review for inspiring solutions. — location: [1108](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=1108) ^ref-33031

---
One at a time, the person who suggested each product gives a tour – showing the whole team what’s so cool about it. — location: [1117](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=1117) ^ref-57821

---
Each tour should be around three minutes long. — location: [1118](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=1118) ^ref-28198

---
Start by asking the person who’s giving the tour, “What’s the big idea here that might be useful?” — location: [1122](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=1122) ^ref-56396

---
For now, don’t make decisions and don’t debate. Just capture anything that might be useful. — location: [1132](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=1132) ^ref-49823

---
But there will be no brainstorming; no shouting over one another; no deferring judgment so wacky ideas can flourish. Instead, you’ll work individually, take your time, and sketch. — location: [1160](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=1160) ^ref-28875

---
it will be the quality of the solutions that matters, — location: [1180](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=1180) ^ref-8380

---
We’re asking you to sketch because we’re convinced it’s the fastest and easiest way to transform abstract ideas into concrete solutions. — location: [1189](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=1189) ^ref-8992

---
working alone generate better solutions than groups brainstorming out loud. — location: [1193](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=1193) ^ref-15122

First, copy down the long-term goal. Next, look at the map, the How Might We questions, and the notes from your Lightning Demos. — location: [1223](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=1223) ^ref-11585

Circle the notes that stand out. — location: [1230](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=1230) ^ref-6104

Now that everyone has a pile of notes, it’s time to switch into idea mode. In — location: [1231](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=1231) ^ref-33606

Each person takes his or her strongest ideas and rapidly sketches eight variations in eight minutes. — location: [1240](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=1240) ^ref-51590

Crazy 8s is also a great writing exercise. If your idea contains words or marketing headlines or any other bits of text, you can use Crazy 8s to improve your phrasing. — location: [1250](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=1250) ^ref-48154

These sketches will be looked at – and judged! – by the rest of the team. They need to be detailed, thought-out, and easy to understand. Each sketch will be a three-panel storyboard — location: [1261](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=1261) ^ref-35545

Make it self-explanatory On Wednesday morning, you’ll post your sketch on the wall for everyone to see. It needs to explain itself. Think of this sketch as the first test for your idea.

Wednesday, when you evaluate everyone’s sketch, this anonymity will make it much easier to critique and choose the best ideas. — location: [1272](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=1272) ^ref-52872

One surprising constant: the importance of writing. — location: [1277](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=1277) ^ref-41097

In a sprint with seven people, you’ll have roughly fifteen to twenty ideas in all. 5.  Everyone takes two minutes and quietly chooses his or her favorite idea from the whiteboard. 6.  Going around the room, each person calls out his or her favorite. For each “vote,” draw a dot next to the chosen idea on the whiteboard. 7.  The Decider makes the final decision. As always, she can choose to follow the votes or not. — location: [1592](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=1592) ^ref-34562

You’ll want at least one Asset Collector on Thursday. It’s not a glamorous role (although “asset collector” does sound glamorous), but it’s one of the keys to rapid prototyping. Your prototype will likely include photos, icons, or sample content that you don’t need to make from scratch. Your Asset Collectors will scour the web, image libraries, your own products, and any other conceivable place to find these elements. This speeds up the work of your Makers, who don’t have to pause and go collect every bit and piece they need for the prototype. — location: [1994](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B017S92JUY&location=1994) ^ref-11451

Once the customer is comfortably seated in the interview room, the Interviewer should say something like: “Thanks for coming in today! We’re always trying to improve our product, and getting your honest feedback is a really important part of that. “This interview will be pretty informal.
