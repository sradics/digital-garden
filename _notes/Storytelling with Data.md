Picture a blank page or a blank screen: every single element you add to that page or screen takes up cognitive load on the part of your audience. — location: [704](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=704) ^ref-11155

When we’re at the point of communicating our analysis to our audience, we really want to be in the explanatory space, meaning you have a specific thing you want to explain, — location: [771](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=771) ^ref-37832

Avoid general audiences, such as “internal and external stakeholders” or “anyone who might be interested”—by trying to communicate to too many different people with disparate needs at once, you put yourself in a position where you can’t communicate to any one of them as effectively as you could if you narrowed your target audience. — location: [798](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=798) ^ref-40950

In Nancy Duarte’s book Resonate, she recommends thinking of your audience as the hero and outlines specific strategies for getting to know your audience, segmenting your audience, and creating common ground.

those communicating with data need to take a more confident stance when it comes to making specific observations and recommendations based on their analysis. — location: [825](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=825) ^ref-58331

And know that even if you highlight or recommend the wrong thing, it prompts the right sort of conversation focused on action. — location: [827](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=827) ^ref-46029

---
Suggesting possible next steps can be a great way to get the conversation going because it gives your audience something to react to rather than starting with a blank slate. — location: [829](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=829) ^ref-33356

Who is the audience or decision maker? What do we know about them? What biases does our audience have that might make them supportive of or resistant to our message? What data is available that would strengthen our case? Is our audience familiar with this data, or is it new? Where are the risks: what factors could weaken our case and do we need to proactively address them?

You have to really know your stuff—know what the most important pieces are as well as what isn’t essential in the most stripped-down version. — location: [943](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=943) ^ref-551

It must articulate your unique point of view; It must convey what’s at stake; and It must be a complete sentence. — location: [959](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=959) ^ref-29755

---
The storyboard establishes a structure for your communication. — location: [980](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=980) ^ref-50469

It is a visual outline of the content you plan to create. — location: [980](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=980) ^ref-3264

It is too easy to go into slide-generating mode without thinking about how the pieces fit together and end up with a massive presentation deck that says nothing effectively. — location: [984](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=984) ^ref-58226

---
This attachment can be such that, even if we know what we’ve created isn’t exactly on the mark or should be changed or eliminated, we are sometimes resistant to doing so because of the work we’ve already put in to get it to where it is. — location: [986](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=986) ^ref-21335

---
Avoid this unnecessary attachment (and work!) by starting low tech. Use a whiteboard, Post-it notes, or plain paper. — location: [989](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=989) ^ref-29732

---
Beyond potentially being misleading, putting one or only a couple of numbers in a table or graph simply causes the numbers to lose some of their oomph. When you have a number or two that you want to communicate, think about using the numbers themselves. — location: [1023](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1023) ^ref-23927

this case, a simple sentence would suffice: 20% of children had a traditional stay-at-home mom in 2012, compared to 41% in 1970. — location: [1035](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1035) ^ref-19162

When you have just a number or two that you want to communicate: use the numbers directly. — location: [1046](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1046) ^ref-51537

Tables interact with our verbal system, which means that we read them. — location: [1052](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1052) ^ref-31449

---
Tables are great for just that—communicating to a mixed audience whose members will each look for their particular row of interest. If you need to communicate multiple different units of measure, this is also typically easier with a table than a graph. — location: [1053](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1053) ^ref-13827

---
good idea. As your audience reads it, you lose their ears and attention to make your point verbally. — location: [1057](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1057) ^ref-61584

---
One thing to keep in mind with a table is that you want the design to fade into the background, letting the data take center stage. — location: [1062](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1062) ^ref-49194

---
For more on table design, check out Stephen Few’s book, Show Me the Numbers. There is an entire chapter dedicated to the design of tables, with discussion on the structural components of tables and best practices in table design. — location: [1073](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1073) ^ref-49281

---
Graphing applications (like Excel) typically have conditional formatting functionality built in that allows you to apply formatting — location: [1092](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1092) ^ref-42562

---
graphs interact with our visual system, which is faster at processing information. — location: [1100](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1100) ^ref-10799

---
Scatterplots can be useful for showing the relationship between two things, because they allow you to encode data simultaneously on a horizontal x-axis and vertical y-axis to see whether and what relationship exists. — location: [1114](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1114) ^ref-19531

---
Line graphs are most commonly used to plot continuous data. — location: [1133](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1133) ^ref-15422

---
Because the points are physically connected via the line, it implies a connection between the points that may not make sense for categorical data — location: [1133](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1133) ^ref-11482

---
the data plotted must be in consistent intervals. I recently saw a graph where the units on the x-axis were decades from 1900 forward (1910, 1920, 1930, etc.) and then switched to yearly after 2010 (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014). — location: [1153](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1153) ^ref-49503

---
Slopegraphs can be useful when you have two time periods or points of comparison and want to quickly show relative increases and decreases or differences across various categories between the two data points. — location: [1159](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1159) ^ref-10324

---
categorical data, where information is organized into groups. — location: [1184](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1184) ^ref-16675

---
Rather, bar charts should be leveraged because they are common, as this means less of a learning curve for your audience. — location: [1188](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1188) ^ref-48416

---
Note that, because of how our eyes compare the relative end points of the bars, it is important that bar charts always have a zero baseline (where the x-axis crosses the y-axis at zero), otherwise you get a false visual comparison. — location: [1192](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1192) ^ref-33041

---
The y-axis labels that were placed on the right-hand side of the original visual were moved — location: [1216](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1216) ^ref-22099

---
The data labels that were originally outside of the bars were pulled inside to reduce clutter. — location: [1217](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1217) ^ref-29418

---
When graphing data, a common decision to make is whether to preserve the axis labels or eliminate the axis and instead label the data points directly. — location: [1222](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1222) ^ref-30995

---
big-picture trends, think about preserving the axis but deemphasizing it by making it grey. — location: [1223](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1223) ^ref-46320

They are meant to allow you to compare totals across categories and also see the subcomponent pieces within a given category. — location: [1253](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1253) ^ref-4021

If I had to pick a single go-to graph for categorical data, it would be the horizontal bar chart, which flips the vertical version on its side. Why? Because it is extremely easy to read. — location: [1294](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1294) ^ref-2524

If the biggest category is the most important, think about putting that first and ordering the rest of the categories in decreasing numerical order. Or if the smallest is most important, put that at the top and order by ascending data values. — location: [1313](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1313) ^ref-57137

3D skews our numbers, making them difficult or impossible to interpret or compare. — location: [1422](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1422) ^ref-31885

---
Don’t show the second y-axis. Instead, label the data points that belong on this axis directly. Pull the graphs apart vertically and have a separate y-axis for each (both along the left) but leverage the same x-axis across both. — location: [1447](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1447) ^ref-27177

Alternative 1, where each data point is labeled explicitly, puts more attention on the specific numbers. Alternative 2, — location: [1465](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1465) ^ref-56751

There is an easy way to test this, which is to create your visual and show it to a friend or colleague. — location: [1476](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1476) ^ref-1800

Because of this, when it comes to tables and graphs, I like to upper-left-most justify the text (title, axis titles, legend). — location: [1664](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=1664) ^ref-9680
