First, she translated elements of the scientific method including hypothesis testing, inductive logic, and deductive logic into business-centric thinking. Ms. Minto advocates inductive logic for most problem-solving exercises, stressing the importance of considering mutually-exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE) sets of ideas. Second, she combined the military’s bottom-line-up-front (BLUF) technique with journalism’s inverted pyramid narrative style to create a top-down approach to business-centric writing. — location: [128](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=128) ^ref-64817

The question captures the most intense query raised in a reader’s mind in response to the complication – often “why?” or “how?” Note the question is often implied and therefore not typically written into the — location: [143](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=143) ^ref-55314

SCQA framework. Instead of being used only to craft introductions, the — location: [147](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=147) ^ref-54312

framework became the organizing principle for entire presentations. — location: [147](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=147) ^ref-14574

---
The resulting situation-complication-resolution (SCR) not only has a memorable rhyme to it, but also conforms to a beautiful three-act narrative structure. — location: [149](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=149) ^ref-11588

Tip 1: Define the problem and make sure it is worth solving — location: [154](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=154) ^ref-35913

---
scoping is called “moving up the issue tree.” — location: [167](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=167) ^ref-56033

---
encourages clear thought and facilitates clear communication. — location: [169](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=169) ^ref-40308

---
“How…?” questions tend to be the most common since the answers offer solutions in the form of steps or methods. “Why…” questions are the next most common since the answers explain root causes. Though “What…?”, “Who…?”, “When…?”, and “Where…?” are rare, use them if appropriate. — location: [171](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=171) ^ref-23271

---
cannot be sure until you flesh out the issue tree by filling in the mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE: pronounced ‘me-see’) set of issues. — location: [195](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=195) ^ref-22150

---
Mutually exclusive means the issues are independent of each other. — location: [196](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=196) ^ref-5114

---
The McKinsey best practice for filling out an issue tree is to fully complete each level (outside-in for outline form; top-down for hierarchical graph form) before going deeper. — location: [198](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=198) ^ref-2861

---
An issue tree is an amazing and highly efficient tool for uncovering what matters so you can get a lot done in very little time. — location: [208](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=208) ^ref-35797

appears to be a set of solutions is merely a set of initial hypotheses, proposed explanations that now must be rigorously tested. — location: [215](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=215) ^ref-31827

---
good problem solver will search for facts, all the while updating the hypothesis. Great problem solvers not only seek information that confirms their hypothesis but also mercilessly hunt for disconfirming information. — location: [216](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=216) ^ref-11140

---
Rather, your only options are to either reject or fail-to-reject the hypothesis. — location: [218](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=218) ^ref-10971

---
When you think about it, decisions in your personal or professional life are pretty much that way, too. You can never know with absolute certainty that you are making the right or best decision; you do the best you can with the information you have at the time. — location: [219](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=219) ^ref-52226

---
hypothesis tree is a set of decisive answers, represented in outline or hierarchical form, to the issue tree questions. “How can we improve profitability?” becomes “We can improve profitability by …”; “How can we lower total cost” becomes “We can lower total cost by …”; and so on. — location: [221](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=221) ^ref-57233

Tip 5: Prioritize your hypotheses for impact — location: [226](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=226) ^ref-41661

Given the ultimate goal is to have the largest positive impact on the client’s business, you must prioritize your hypotheses. — location: [229](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=229) ^ref-17884

storyline arguments are carried by dots (bullet points) and the supporting facts are sketched out with indented dashes (hyphens). — location: [249](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=249) ^ref-42244

there is simply too much information available inside and outside of most corporations. — location: [267](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=267) ^ref-39182

However, the best go through the exact same anthropological interview processes with the bottom performers. — location: [290](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=290) ^ref-22485

To mitigate that bias, strive to ask open-ended, non-leading questions and spend the vast majority of the conversation as a listener. — location: [294](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=294) ^ref-54554

In real engagements, consultants move back-and-forth between problem definition, issue trees, hypothesis trees, and storyboards as they gather and synthesize new information. — location: [297](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=297) ^ref-36786

---
The situation-complication-resolution (SCR) storytelling framework requires only that each of the three components exist in the narrative. However, presenters can begin their stories with any one of the three in order to affect the emotions of their audiences. — location: [305](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=305) ^ref-62869

starting a presentation with a resolution should be reserved for rare circumstances. — location: [312](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=312) ^ref-25635

If your audience is overly complacent, begin with the complication to create a sense of urgency. — location: [313](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=313) ^ref-23176

---
typical business meetings, decision makers are not complacent. Therefore, it is unwise to increase their tension too quickly at the beginning of your presentation. — location: [315](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=315) ^ref-11595

starting with the situation is just right. — location: [317](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=317) ^ref-49671

“What” titles, technically noun phrases, lack the audience-focused emotional punch you find in “so-what” titles describing outcomes. — location: [322](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=322) ^ref-46099

titles must orient your listeners to your overall objective. — location: [323](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=323) ^ref-52542

Showing an agenda slide immediately after your title slide is one of the best ways to control tension. — location: [358](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=358) ^ref-8164

First, audiences expect it. Second, by knowing where you are going, they are more likely to hold questions until relevant sections. — location: [359](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=359) ^ref-22912

Keep agenda slide titles short and sweet so they can be ignored — location: [361](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=361) ^ref-40234

agenda slides should be unobtrusive since the audience’s focus should be on the body — location: [367](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=367) ^ref-64002

When I want the people I am presenting to in that mode, I start my bullet with “Approve…,” “Adopt…,” or “Authorize…” The second mode executives operate in is problem-solving mode. If you start a bullet with “Problem solve…,” “Explore…,” or “Brainstorm…,” your audience knows you are seeking thoughtful input rather than a quick decision. Finally, the third mode in which executives — location: [394](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=394) ^ref-4644

their core, business presentations are about clarity and efficiency, not literary excellence. — location: [406](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=406) ^ref-6961

This long-form version has a bit of embellishment around the bullets but does not, and should not, reveal too much content nor trigger too much tension. — location: [417](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=417) ^ref-18977

---
presentation is often the hardest part of the strategic storytelling process. To make the job easier, I follow a few simple rules. First, the beginning must frame the current state, including relevant history, of the fundamental — location: [419](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=419) ^ref-18868

---
Second, the beginning should rely on facts drawn from internal or external information sources. Third, the beginning should be uncontroversial in the sense that your audience already knows the information, or at least can be assumed to have a sense of it. — location: [421](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=421) ^ref-57938

The beginning of a business presentation should orient the audience — location: [423](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=423) ^ref-45448

“own the flow,” each slide should trigger a question answered by the title of the next slide — location: [431](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=431) ^ref-20758

---
Importantly, each item is part of a mutually-exclusive and collectively-exhaustive set summarizing at a high-level everything else to follow in the situation. — location: [447](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=447) ^ref-689

---
In depth-order tree traversal, any time you encounter multiple nodes at the same horizontal level, you go down first and only go across when you cannot go down any more. — location: [461](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=461) ^ref-11115

---
presentations, use depth-first traversal since this method progressively introduces concepts and then “peels the onion.” Additionally, this method more closely approximates how stories are told. This is painfully obvious when you consider telling a simple story of “Jane’s Day” in each of the two ways as follows: — location: [464](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=464) ^ref-47855

The third level, one many decision makers fail to consider, is maintaining the status quo; the decision to “do nothing” is indeed a decision and can often be the best option. — location: [634](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=634) ^ref-62583

The decision makers in the audience not only are judging the quality of the solutions offered, but also are judging the quality of the person offering the ideas. — location: [650](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=650) ^ref-59491

Choosing how to order actions in the resolution section is critically important. — location: [653](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=653) ^ref-59023

---
The default for prioritizing solutions is in descending order, highest to lowest, of impact since this releases the anxiety built at the end of the complication section as fast as possible. — location: [653](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=653) ^ref-45896

---
However, this default does not work when the actions must be taken in sequence (i.e., phased) or when the audience needs to follow an emotional path to accept the recommendation. — location: [655](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=655) ^ref-47789

A key principle in storytelling is that characters always take the minimum conservative action given the circumstances in which they find themselves. — location: [660](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=660) ^ref-16007

29: Create an epilogue for critical information beyond the main storyline — location: [731](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=731) ^ref-9253

(Note: An epilogue is different than an Appendix in that the former is presented while the latter serves only as reference material.) — location: [733](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=733) ^ref-36570

---
While common in movies, they are rare in presentations because the content in an epilogue can easily diminish the power of the recommendations just delivered. — location: [734](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWE81VE&location=734) ^ref-39947
