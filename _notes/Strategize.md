The product strategy describes how the long-term goal is attained; it includes the product’s value proposition, market, key features, and business goals. The product roadmap shows how the product strategy is put into action by stating specific releases with dates, goals, and features. — location: [121](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=121) ^ref-21450

product strategy comes in: it helps you manage your product proactively by looking at the big picture. — location: [166](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=166) ^ref-12867

---
A product strategy is a high-level plan that helps you realize your vision or overarching goal. It explains who the product is for, and why people would want to buy and use it; what the product is, and what makes it stands out; and what the business goals are, and why it is worthwhile for your company to invest in — location: [167](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=167) ^ref-4110

---
The market describes the target customers and users of your product: the people who are likely to buy and use — location: [173](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=173) ^ref-32123

---
The needs comprise the main problem your product solves or the primary benefit it provides. — location: [174](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=174) ^ref-61265

---
The key features and differentiators are those aspects of your product that are crucial to creating value for the customers and users and that entice people to choose it over competing offerings. — location: [176](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=176) ^ref-54017

---
but to focus on the three to five features that influence a person’s decision to buy and use the product. — location: [180](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=180) ^ref-64569

---
The business goals capture how your product is going to benefit your company, and why it is worthwhile for the company to invest in the product. — location: [181](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=181) ^ref-5535

---
Being clear on the business goals allows you to select the right key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure your product’s performance. — location: [183](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=183) ^ref-44023

---
As a consequence, you should review and adjust your product strategy on a regular basis—at least once a quarter as a rule of thumb. — location: [188](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=188) ^ref-62922

---
it is helpful to begin by capturing that vision. The vision is the ultimate reason for creating your product; it describes the positive change the product should bring about. — location: [191](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=191) ^ref-18121

---
vision, then, could be to help people live more healthily; the strategy would be to create an app that monitors their food intake in conjunction — location: [196](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=196) ^ref-61983

---
effective vision has four qualities: it is big, shared, inspiring, and concise. — location: [200](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=200) ^ref-26054

---
What’s more, it makes it easier to change the strategy (if necessary) while keeping the vision stable. — location: [202](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=202) ^ref-19411

---
The beauty of a shared vision is that it motivates and unites people: it acts as the product’s true north, facilitates collaboration, and provides continuity in an ever-changing world.2 An inspiring vision resonates with the people working on the product, and it provides motivation and guidance even if the going gets tough. — location: [205](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=205) ^ref-59691

---
A powerful exercise is to ask the key stakeholders to formulate their visions for the product and to share them with one another. — location: [209](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=209) ^ref-62212

tactics—the details required to develop a great product, including the user stories and the design sketches. — location: [213](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=213) ^ref-31778

---
Similarly, if you struggle to find a valid strategy, then this could indicate that your vision is a hazy, unattainable dream that you should wake up from. — location: [224](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=224) ^ref-61360

A product is a means to an end. — location: [239](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=239) ^ref-32948

---
By benefiting its customers and users, it should create value for your company. — location: [239](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=239) ^ref-15249

---
It is therefore important that your product strategy supports the overall business strategy. — location: [239](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=239) ^ref-709

---
A business strategy describes how your company wants to achieve its overall objectives. — location: [240](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=240) ^ref-29231

the business strategy has to direct the product strategy, — location: [247](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=247) ^ref-7600

---
To put it a different way, the product vision should be in line with the overall company vision, and the product strategy should help implement the business strategy. If your business does not have an overall strategy, or if — location: [250](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=250) ^ref-45331

Products are value-creating vehicles. — location: [255](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=255) ^ref-50994

---
a product has to offer something new; it has to innovate to a greater or lesser extent. — location: [255](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=255) ^ref-41928

---
It’s important to understand which — location: [257](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=257) ^ref-37093

---
innovation strategy your product executes — location: [257](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=257) ^ref-5246

---
Core innovations optimize existing products for established markets; they draw on the skills and assets your company already has in place, and they make incremental changes to current products. — location: [264](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=264) ^ref-48066

---
You should aim to protect the product, focus on — location: [270](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=270) ^ref-8067

---
operational excellence, avoid mistakes, optimize the existing business model, and use proven technologies—unless you decide to make a bigger change to your product, such as taking it to a new market, which would turn it into an adjacent innovation — location: [270](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=270) ^ref-41841

---
Adjacent innovations involve leveraging something your company does well into a new space—for example, taking an existing product to a market that’s new to the company or creating a new product for an existing market. — location: [273](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=273) ^ref-51064

---
Adjacent innovations allow you to open up new revenue sources, but they require fresh — location: [278](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=278) ^ref-34870

---
insights into customer needs, demand trends, market structure, competitive dynamics, technologies, and other market variables. — location: [278](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=278) ^ref-33698

---
Instead, a disruptive innovation typically solves a customer problem in a better, more convenient, or cheaper way than existing alternatives. — location: [294](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=294) ^ref-6715

---
company has to do things differently and therefore disrupt itself—at least to a certain extent. — location: [302](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=302) ^ref-5972

---
requires an entrepreneurial mind-set and the ability to experiment, to make mistakes, and to fail. — location: [307](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=307) ^ref-31289

---
autonomy to think outside the box, break with traditions, and to iterate and fail quickly. — location: [308](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=308) ^ref-46914

---
Be aware that creating a reliable financial forecast is impossible for disruptive innovations. — location: [309](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=309) ^ref-6564

---
Requiring a solid business case can prevent you from creating disruptive products. — location: [310](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=310) ^ref-4190

---
The product life cycle model in Figure 7 presents five stages: development, introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. — location: [346](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=346) ^ref-30818

---
In order to leverage the product life cycle model, you have to define the business benefits your product delivers and then track them over time. — location: [357](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=357) ^ref-57405

---
pivot—that is, to significantly change your strategy and choose a different path for attaining your vision. — location: [374](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=374) ^ref-16125

---
The trick is therefore to launch a good-enough product, a product that does a good job of meeting the primary customer need, and to subsequently adapt and enhance it. — location: [379](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=379) ^ref-33446

---
After the launch your objective is to achieve PMF and to experience growth as quickly as possible. — location: [386](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=386) ^ref-65125

---
then don’t make the mistake of overoptimizing your product for the early market. — location: [404](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=404) ^ref-46541

---
Once you start to experience significant growth, you have achieved PMF. — location: [417](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=417) ^ref-22422

---
a product that serves an ever-growing audience, is becoming increasingly feature-rich, and requires more and more people to develop — location: [423](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=423) ^ref-9686

---
Sometimes, though, the opposite strategy is more appropriate, and instead of adding you may want to remove features and declutter your product. — location: [434](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=434) ^ref-22685

---
The Product Life Cycle and the Product Strategy — location: [444](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=444) ^ref-58059

You should therefore regularly assess your product’s performance and adjust your strategy accordingly. — location: [462](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=462) ^ref-28751

---
The Product Vision Board is a simple yet powerful tool that helps you with this. I have designed it to describe, communicate, test, correct, and refine the product strategy. — location: [465](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=465) ^ref-31631

the value the product should create for your company. — location: [475](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=475) ^ref-27889

You can download the Product Vision Board template from my website, www.romanpichler.com — location: [482](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=482) ^ref-3427

But you should also understand how to reach the desired business benefits stated in your strategy, and how you can monetize your product—be — location: [487](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=487) ^ref-58614

include subscription, freemium, advertising, and bait and hook. — location: [490](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=490) ^ref-1123

the Business Model Canvas (Osterwalder and Pigneur 2010) is probably the most well known. — location: [499](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=499) ^ref-12593

You can download the Extended Vision Board for free from my website, where more information on the tool is available. — location: [514](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=514) ^ref-2881

but it does not quantify the revenue generated or the cost incurred. — location: [516](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=516) ^ref-35421

which forecasts the — location: [516](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=516) ^ref-23141

product’s financial performance, typically over the next two to three years. — location: [517](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=517) ^ref-9326

---
For core products, creating such a business case is usually feasible; for adjacent products, it can be very hard; for disruptive products, it is impossible, as the market for your product does not exist yet. — location: [519](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=519) ^ref-20520

---
together with the inaction — location: [521](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=521) ^ref-24606

Key performance indicators (KPIs) are metrics that measure your product’s performance. — location: [524](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=524) ^ref-36677

---
They help you understand if the product is meetings its business goals, and if the product strategy is working. — location: [524](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=524) ^ref-63594

---
Using KPIs and collecting the right data helps you balance opinions, beliefs, and gut feelings with empirical evidence, which increases the chances of making the right decisions and providing a successful product. — location: [527](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=527) ^ref-17428

---
In order to choose the right KPIs, use the business goals stated in the product strategy. — location: [530](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=530) ^ref-65000

---
I can’t tell if the product is making enough revenue and meeting its business goal; — location: [534](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=534) ^ref-30773

---
One helpful technique for addressing this challenge is to work with ratios and ranges — location: [537](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=537) ^ref-36097

---
company’s revenue by 5 to 10 percent within one year after its launch, for instance. — location: [538](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=538) ^ref-50652

---
Whenever you select an indicator, check if the indicator actually measures performance or just makes your product look good. — location: [546](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=546) ^ref-7068

---
Lagging and Leading Indicators — location: [561](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=561) ^ref-21371

---
Financial indicators, such as revenue and profit, and customer metrics, like engagement and referral rates, are the two most common indicator types in my experience. — location: [567](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=567) ^ref-6703

---
But if at the same time the team motivation is low or the code quality is deteriorating, you should still be concerned. These indicators suggest that achieving product success will be much harder in the future. — location: [570](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=570) ^ref-27570

---
The measurements in Table 4 are grouped into four perspectives: financial, customer, product and process, and people. — location: [579](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=579) ^ref-28231

---
As Figure 14 shows, the business goals captured in the product strategy provide the context to identify the right product goals. The latter describe the specific benefits major releases should provide. For example, the goal for the first public release of a new product could be to acquire customers and build a user community (product goals) to eventually generate revenue (business goal). The goals in the roadmap do a similar job for the sprint goals; — location: [650](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=650) ^ref-32274

A stakeholder is anyone who has a stake in your product—anyone who is affected by it or shows an interest in — location: [666](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=666) ^ref-9325

help you need to develop, release, and provide the product. — location: [668](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=668) ^ref-34174

---
stakeholders, you need to determine how to best engage the individuals. — location: [672](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=672) ^ref-17273

---
helps you with this challenge is the Power-Interest Grid, described in Eden and Ackermann — location: [673](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=673) ^ref-7683

---
This results in four stakeholder groups: players, subjects, context setters, and the crowd, as — location: [675](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=675) ^ref-31257

---
To find out if a stakeholder is likely to be interested in your product, consider if the person will be affected by it; and to understand if a stakeholder has high power, ask yourself if the individual can influence, or even veto, product decisions. — location: [676](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=676) ^ref-5074

---
I find that close collaboration is particularly important to develop a valid and shared product strategy. — location: [685](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=685) ^ref-13990

---
Great products are not built on weak compromises. — location: [689](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=689) ^ref-63366

---
Subjects can make great allies who can help you secure understanding and buy-in for your product across the business. — location: [691](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=691) ^ref-45234

---
People with low interest but high power are called context setters. They affect the product’s context, but they take little interest — location: [693](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=693) ^ref-42832

---
Regularly consult them to ensure that their opinions are heard—for instance, by having one-on-one meetings. — location: [695](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=695) ^ref-4030

---
Use data and empirical evidence to back up your arguments and convince the context setters. — location: [697](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=697) ^ref-31736

---
keep them informed; give them access to the product’s wiki website, for instance, or update them on significant strategy changes. — location: [700](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=700) ^ref-45668

You should therefore regularly review and adjust it. — location: [710](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=710) ^ref-8917

the product performance, the competition, the trends, and the company goals and capabilities. — location: [712](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=712) ^ref-57219

---
Looking at your company and any changes in its business strategy will help you understand if the business goals captured in the product strategy are still valid. — location: [718](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=718) ^ref-9582

---
For younger products and dynamic markets, I recommend reviewing the product strategy once per month; — location: [721](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=721) ^ref-20185

---
Segmenting the market means dividing the potential customers and users into distinct groups. — location: [731](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=731) ^ref-60736

---
To put it differently, you should be able to tell who belongs to a segment and who does not. — location: [734](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=734) ^ref-44343

---
What’s more, each segment should be homogenous, and the people within it should respond to your product in the same way. — location: [734](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=734) ^ref-14555

---
Note that segmentation is not only beneficial for developing new products; it also helps you derive variants from an existing product. — location: [738](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=738) ^ref-4238

---
You can form segments that are based on the customer properties, or on the benefits that your product provides. Common customer properties include — location: [741](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=741) ^ref-4135

---
demographics such as age, gender, marital status, occupation, education, and income; — location: [742](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=742) ^ref-35521

---
alternative approach is to divide the market using the benefit the product provides or the problem it addresses — location: [750](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=750) ^ref-36047

disruptive product, segment first by benefit. — location: [758](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=758) ^ref-34094

segments. It encourages you to assess your segments according to their attractiveness and the strength of your business, as Figure 18 shows. — location: [782](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=782) ^ref-10065

Need: How strong is the need, and how much does the group benefit from the product? Segment size: How big is it? Growth rate: Does it show signs of growth? Competitors: Who are the main competitors, and how fierce is the competition?

Do you have the necessary skills, knowledge, and expertise to do so? If not, can you acquire them? How difficult and expensive is it to acquire customers? Do you have the right marketing and sales channels in place? If not, what will it take to establish them? — location: [793](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=793) ^ref-33131

“Markets that don’t exist can’t be analyzed,” — location: [797](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01F749SF6&location=797) ^ref-23621
