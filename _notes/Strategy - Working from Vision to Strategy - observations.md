# Strategy - Working from Vision to Strategy - observations
In 2023-05 I was involved in a team to create the product strategy for 3 years. This note outlines some observations & learnings on structure

The approach to work backwards from the company vision (markers) to more concrete sub-vision per bigger endavours/themes seems to work, well. Each theme can then be filled with initiatives/projects on the horizons. 

We used time horizon 1..3 for year 1..3.
