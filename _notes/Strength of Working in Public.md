Plant, Grow, Share  
  
â†’ I turned 1,000+ scattered thoughts into a thriving digital garden  
  
In many conversations I want to share a follow-ups with insights.  
  
In the past, I struggled to collect such insights.  
My information was scattered and not in a shareable format.  
  
This either meant investing extra time or skipping sharing altogether.  
  
This was often a missed opportunity to help others.  
  
This changed when I started publishing most of my thoughts publicly.  
  
I cultivate a digital garden for this purpose:  
  
â†’ A place where I plant seeds of my insights  
â†’ These seeds grow from seedlings into mature knowledge trees over time.  

â†’ I take small steps every day  
â†’ Now, my digital garden has grown to over 1,000 pages.  
â†’ With topics from my 12 main domains I'm learning about  
  
Among them:  
  
â†’ Building high performing teams  
â†’ Building a Second Brain  
â†’ Learning how to Learn  
â†’ ... and many more  

I've observed that I share insights much faster in conversations.  
I can help others better.  
  
The cool thing is:  
This digital garden is low effort.  
Costs are marginal.  
  
At the same time, it enables:  
  
â†’ Others to build on my learnings  
â†’ Sharing early, sharing often  
â†’ Exploration and  
â†’ Serendipity  
  
It's an effect of compounding knowledge.  
  
Come and pick your fruit (or vegetable) of knowledge too.  
I'll share some pointers to interesting topics in the comments.  
  
What is ONE way you share insights with others?  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
P.S.  
I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease
