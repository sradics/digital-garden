Does your company suffer from poor decision making?
(Discover your way to switch to taking smart decisions)

We lack from taking decisions being trapped by analysis paralysis and information overload or rush into decisions with overconfidence or just based on instinct because we lack emotional or physical resources.

You can switch from superficial first-level thinking and snapshot decisions to smart decisions using models that foster complex second-level thinking.

DECIDE is a model to taking decision that is easy to apply and stands for:

+ (D)etermine the problem - take a step back and understand the topic
+ (E)stablish the criteria - get clarity by listing the decision parameters (like price, required features) and order by priority
+ (C)onsider alternatives - compare different alternatives leveraging your criteria list. Set a timer to avoid analysis paralysis by overthinking.
+ (I)dentify the choice - Rate each alternative based on your comparison and make a choice.  
+ (D)evelop the plan of action - move with the decision and take action
+ (E)valuate the solution - examine the outcome of your decision and improve your decision making over time

"In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing." (Theodore Roosevelt)

So next time you need to take an important decision, take a step back and apply DECIDE.  (and let me know how it worked)

Please share your experience with decision making. What works best for you? Where do you struggle?
