## AVOIDANCE OF ACCOUNTABILITY
### you see it on
* creates resentment (Abneigung) among teammembers who have different standards of performance
* encourages mediocrity (Mittelm√§√üigkeit)
* misses deadlines and key deliverables
* places an undue burden on the team leader as the sole source of discipline

### leads to

## team members shift their attention to areas other than collective results

* fear of jeopardizing (aufs Spiel setzen) a valuable personal relationship 
* leads to deteriorate of relationsship(abwerten), Standards go down
* good team have high expectations on each other and show it
* build peer pressure

### turned around

* ensures that poor performers feel pressure to improve
* identifies potential problems quickly by questioning one another's approaches without hesitation (Z√∂gerung)
* establishes respect among team members who are held to the same high standards
* *avoids excessive bureaucracy around performance management and corrective action

### How to overcome

* publication of goals and standards
    * clarify publicity exactly what the team needs to achieve, who needs to deliver what, how everyone must behave in order to succeed (open team goals)
    * enemy - ambiguity
    * keep goals open and make them visible
* simple and regular progress reviews
    * give feedback on their performance (from teammember to teammembers)
* team rewards (shifting away from individual goals)

### leader

* Leader must not be the only source of discipline
* must be arbiter (Schiedsrichter) if the team itself fails (rarly)

## INATTENTION TO RESULTS

## team members care about something other than the collective goals

### TODO

* make team goals and development more important than each individual team members goals
* be result focussed - desire to win
* make results clear, reward only those behaviours and actions that contribute to those results

* benefits from individuals who subjugate their own goals/interests for the good of the team

### How to overcome

* Public declaration of results
    * make public proclamations about intended success
    * commit publicly to specific results - and wor with a passionate, even desperate desire to achieve those results
* Never use We'll do our best
* Result based rewards
    * tie compensation to the achievement of specific outcomes

### leader

* set tone to focus on results
* must be selfless and objective
* reserve rewards and recognition for those who make real contributions to the achievement of group goals

## ABSENCE OF TRUST

**_TRUST - confidence among team members that their peers intentions are good and that there is no reason to be protective or careful around the group_**

* teammembers must get vulnerable with one another
* weaknesses, skill deficiencies, interpersonal shortcomings, mistakes, request for help
* effect - focus their energy and attention completely on the job at hand (instead of being political and strategically disingenuous (hinterlistig))
    * (often loose a lot of power in managing behaviours and interactions, reluctant to take risks, dread (f√ºrchten) team meetings, )

## teamwork is impossible

* fail to recognize and tap into one anothers skills and experiences
* waste time and energy managing their behaviours for effect
* hold grudges (Groll, Neid)
* dread meetings and find reasons to avoid spending time together

### turned around

* admit weaknesses and mistakes
* ask for help
* accept questions and input about their areas of responsibility
* give one another the benefit of the doubt before arriving at a negative conclusion
* take risi¬¥ks in offering feedback and assistance
* appreciate and tap into one another's skills and experiences
* focus tiem and energy on important issues, not politics
* offer and accept apologies without hesitation
* look forward to meetings and other opportunities to work as a group

### Overcoming
