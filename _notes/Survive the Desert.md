## Tracking of individual and team contributions
You can use this [supporting Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17bk0RXQ9GHbXsDI8aA0oOv47B-XNTNeNIuVQm2Nqeq0/edit?usp=sharing) for managing individual and team contributions.

## Timing
+ 7' for short explanation and everyone reading through the Survival In the Desert story
	+ Define that it does not make sense to leave the area of the plan. Trying to walk the 65 miles means sure death
+ 7' Individual ranking
+ 10' group ranking (including forming groups)
+ 3' Look together at the results
+ 5' Individual reflection
+ 15' group reflection

## Supporting questions for the reflection
+ What did you observe?
+ What were benefits of collaborating on the task?
