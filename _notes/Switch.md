And that’s the first surprise about change: What looks like a people problem is often a situation problem. — location: [75](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=75) ^ref-747

---
For anything to change, someone has to start acting differently. — location: [82](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=82) ^ref-61144

---
To change someone’s behavior, you’ve got to change that person’s situation. — location: [92](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=92) ^ref-24340

not only their environment but their hearts and minds. — location: [96](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=96) ^ref-37218

unavoidable conclusion is this: Your brain isn’t of one mind. — location: [115](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=115) ^ref-4686

---
First, there’s what we called the emotional side. It’s the part of you that is instinctive, that feels pain and pleasure. Second, there’s the rational side, also known — location: [117](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=117) ^ref-32202

---
as the reflective or conscious system. It’s the part of you that deliberates and analyzes and looks into the future. — location: [118](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=118) ^ref-25271

The Happiness Hypothesis. — location: [125](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=125) ^ref-25043

since the kinds of change we want typically involve short-term sacrifices for long-term payoffs. — location: [133](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=133) ^ref-5138

That fierce instinct you have to protect your kids against harm—that’s the Elephant. That spine-stiffening you feel when you — location: [140](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=140) ^ref-38897

Rider’s great weakness: spinning his wheels. The Rider tends to overanalyze and overthink things. — location: [143](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=143) ^ref-35112

---
The Rider provides the planning and direction, and the Elephant provides the energy. So if you reach the Riders of your team but not the Elephants, team members will have understanding without motivation. If you reach their Elephants but not — location: [146](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=146) ^ref-64108

---
their Riders, they’ll have passion without direction. — location: [148](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=148) ^ref-49367

---
The answer may surprise you: They ran out of self-control. — location: [175](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=175) ^ref-25743

---
In studies like this one, psychologists have discovered that self-control is an exhaustible resource. — location: [175](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=175) ^ref-7736

---
So when their Elephants, inevitably, started complaining about the puzzle task—it’s too hard, it’s no fun, we’re no good at this—their Riders didn’t have enough strength to yank on the reins for more than eight minutes. — location: [178](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=178) ^ref-40634

---
and that’s a good thing because the supervised behavior — location: [188](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=188) ^ref-45887

---
the hard stuff. It’s draining. — location: [189](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=189) ^ref-61063

---
exhausting nature of self-supervision. For instance, people who were asked to — location: [190](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=190) ^ref-35078

---
The bigger the change you’re suggesting, the more it will sap people’s self-control. — location: [197](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=197) ^ref-58715

---
Change is hard because people wear themselves out. And that’s the second surprise about change: What looks like laziness is often exhaustion. — location: [201](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=201) ^ref-7464

---
Remember that if you reach your colleagues’ Riders but not their Elephants, they will have direction without motivation. — location: [236](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=236) ^ref-40703

---
the Rider isn’t sure exactly what direction to go, he tends to lead the Elephant in circles. And as we’ll see, that tendency explains the third and final surprise about change: What — location: [246](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=246) ^ref-36667

---
looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity. Two health researchers, Steve Booth-Butterfield — location: [248](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=248) ^ref-4174

---
you want people to change, you must provide crystal-clear direction. By now, — location: [271](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=271) ^ref-58412

---
Direct the Rider. What looks like — location: [283](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=283) ^ref-12845

---
resistance is often a lack of clarity. So provide crystal-clear direction. (Think 1% milk.) Motivate the Elephant. What looks like laziness is often exhaustion. The Rider can’t get his way by force for very long. So it’s critical that you engage people’s emotional side—get their Elephants on the path and cooperative. (Think of the cookies and radishes study and the boardroom conference table full of gloves.) Shape the Path. What looks like a people problem is often a situation problem. We call the situation (including the surrounding environment) the “Path.” When you shape the Path, you make change more likely, no matter what’s happening with the Rider and Elephant. (Think of the effect of shrinking movie popcorn buckets.) — location: [283](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=283) ^ref-9935

but sometimes an employee would rather lose his job than move out of his comfortable routines. — location: [298](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=298) ^ref-47934

First, he directed his audience’s Riders. — location: [357](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=357) ^ref-57532

---
So he proposed six specific interventions, such as elevating the heads of patients on ventilators, that were known to save lives. By staying laser-focused on these six interventions, Berwick made sure not to exhaust the Riders of his audience with endless behavioral changes. Second, he motivated — location: [360](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=360) ^ref-37441

---
He didn’t challenge people to “overhaul medicine” or “bring TQM to health care.” He challenged them to save 100,000 lives. That speaks to anyone’s Elephant. — location: [367](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=367) ^ref-36720

---
He was designing an environment that made it more likely for hospital administrators to reform. Berwick also knew that behavior was contagious. He used peer pressure to persuade hospitals to join the campaign. — location: [370](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=370) ^ref-43320

---
He also connected people—he matched up people who were struggling to implement the changes with people who had mastered them, almost like the “mentors” found in Alcoholics Anonymous. Berwick was creating a support group for health care reform. — location: [372](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=372) ^ref-8337

---
community for bright spots — location: [404](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=404) ^ref-49231

The mothers needed direction, not motivation. — location: [409](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=409) ^ref-23311

---
These analytical qualities can be extremely helpful, obviously—many problems get solved through analysis—but in situations where change is needed, too much analysis can doom the effort. — location: [473](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=473) ^ref-35368

---
The Rider will see too many problems and spend too much time sizing them — location: [474](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=474) ^ref-13998

---
But they hadn’t changed a thing. — location: [476](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=476) ^ref-41775

---
In tough times, the Rider sees problems everywhere, and “analysis paralysis” often kicks in. The — location: [477](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=477) ^ref-47858

---
That’s why to make progress on a change, you need ways to direct the Rider. — location: [478](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=478) ^ref-3513

---
And that’s why bright spots are so essential, — location: [479](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=479) ^ref-7523

---
Solutions-focused therapists, in contrast, couldn’t care less about archaeology. They don’t dig around for clues about why you act the way you do. They don’t care about your childhood. All they care about is the solution to the problem at hand. — location: [507](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=507) ^ref-4264

---
She learned that understanding a problem doesn’t necessarily solve it—that knowing is not enough. — location: [514](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=514) ^ref-24849

---
Most people, including most therapists, believe the change process has to be complicated and arduous. ‘No pain, no gain’ is the general rule of thumb. — location: [516](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=516) ^ref-29161

small adjustments can work after all, she thought. — location: [522](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=522) ^ref-48538

a miracle solved your drinking problem, what would you be doing differently the next morning? “I don’t know, I can’t imagine.” Try. “Well, all my friends drink, so what do you expect me to do?” I know it’s not easy, but think about it. “Well, there are all sorts of things.” Name one. — location: [536](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=536) ^ref-25406

Let’s replay that scene, where things were working for you. What was happening? How did you behave? Were you smiling? Did you make eye contact? — location: [556](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=556) ^ref-64232

---
you will solve one of the fundamental mysteries of change: What, exactly, needs to be done differently? — location: [563](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=563) ^ref-31204

Go investigate the two successful managers. — location: [571](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=571) ^ref-15744

---
Bottom line: You are spending 80 percent of your time exploring Debbie’s success and finding ways to replicate it. You aren’t obsessing about the manager who was skeptical. You aren’t planning another training program with the same managers to review the material. You are simply asking yourself, “What’s working and how can we do more of it?” That’s the bright-spot philosophy in a single question. — location: [582](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=582) ^ref-29937

---
But the managers’ first reaction to the good news was that it must be bad news! — location: [603](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=603) ^ref-19272

---
That reaction is a good reminder that the Rider’s capacity for analysis is endless. Even successes can look like problems to an overactive Rider. — location: [604](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=604) ^ref-32861

---
and as we’ve seen, anytime you have a bright spot, your mission is to clone it. — location: [614](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=614) ^ref-45829

---
There is a clear asymmetry between the scale of the problem and the scale of the solution. Big problem, small solution. — location: [630](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=630) ^ref-25212

---
Big problems are rarely solved with commensurately big solutions. Instead, they are most often solved by a sequence of small solutions, sometimes over weeks, sometimes over decades. — location: [632](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=632) ^ref-18920

---
When the Rider analyzes a problem, he seeks a solution that befits the scale of it. — location: [634](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=634) ^ref-7177

---
“What’s working, and how can we do more of it?” Sounds simple, doesn’t it? — location: [643](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=643) ^ref-1289

---
Yet, in the real world, this obvious question is almost never asked. Instead, the question we ask is more problem focused: “What’s broken, and how do we fix it? — location: [643](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=643) ^ref-22063

---
When people learn bad stuff about someone else, it’s stickier than good stuff. People pay closer attention to the bad stuff, reflect on it more, remember it longer, and weigh it more heavily in assessing the person overall. — location: [683](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=683) ^ref-46936

Change brings new choices that create uncertainty. — location: [775](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=775) ^ref-46830

Ambiguity is exhausting to the Rider, because the Rider is tugging on the reins of the Elephant, trying to direct the Elephant down a new path. — location: [778](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=778) ^ref-21054

Ambiguity is the enemy. Any successful change requires a translation of ambiguous goals into concrete behaviors. In short, to make a switch, you need to script the critical moves. — location: [789](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=789) ^ref-2369

---
Rule 1: Money would be invested only in projects that would allow ALL to earn more revenue in the short term. Rule 2: The best solution to any problem was the one that would cost the least money up front—even if it ended up costing more in the long term, and even if it was a lower-quality solution. Rule 3: Options that would fix a problem quickly were preferred to slower options that would provide superior long-term fixes. Rule 4: Reusing or recycling existing materials was better than acquiring new materials. — location: [809](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=809) ^ref-53988
