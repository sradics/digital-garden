## Highlights
When assessing conditions and making comparisons, ask: Who has more influential purpose? Who has more skilled leadership? Who is favored by landscape and climate? Who carries out doctrine more skillfully? Who has more capabilities? Who has more highly trained people? Who provides feedback more clearly? This shows who will succeed and who will fail. — location: [6118](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B086SGV3JJ&location=6118) ^ref-50161

Strategy is a mental tapestry of changing intentions for harmonizing and focusing our efforts as a basis for realizing some aim or purpose in an unfolding and often unforeseen world of many bewildering events and many contending interests. — location: [6991](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B086SGV3JJ&location=6991) ^ref-42471

The purpose of strategy is to improve our ability to shape and adapt to unfolding circumstances, so that we (as individuals or as groups or as a culture or as a nation-state) can survive on our own terms.14 — location: [6991](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B086SGV3JJ&location=6991) ^ref-8728

Observe — orient — decide — act (OODA loop) more inconspicuously, more quickly, and with more irregularity as basis to keep or gain initiative as well as shape and shift main effort: to repeatedly and unexpectedly penetrate vulnerabilities and weaknesses exposed by that effort or other effort(s) that tie-up, divert, or drain-away adversary attention (and strength) elsewhere.16 — location: [6993](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B086SGV3JJ&location=6993) ^ref-34664

Without analysis and synthesis across a variety of domains or across a variety of competing independent channels of information, we cannot evolve a new repertoire to deal with unfamiliar phenomena or unforeseen change. — location: [7429](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B086SGV3JJ&location=7429) ^ref-8743

Strategy is the art of manipulating an environment to gain a desirable outcome. It requires in-depth awareness of the environment (i.e. yours and competitors value chains and how this is evolving), the toolsets available (i.e. mechanisms to manipulate the environment) and experience in doing this.21 Strategy is a game of position and movement 21 Simon Wardley.

Finally, act, and then repeat the strategy cycle remembering that there are two types of “why”: the “why” of purpose. The chess master wants to win every chess game. the “why” of movement.

Strategy is complex. There will be uncertainty, emerging patterns and surprises along the way. That’s the very nature of competition due to the involvement of other actors. Embrace this, don’t fall for the temptation that you can plan the future.

Strategy is iterative, not linear. Understand that strategy is iterative. You need to adapt in fast cycles according to the changing environment. The best you can hope for is a direction, a constant process of learning and improvement of your gameplay along the way. — location: [10050](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B086SGV3JJ&location=10050) ^ref-5197
