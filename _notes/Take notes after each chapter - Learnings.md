# Take notes after each chapter - Learnings
With the book [[Notes for Keine Sinnfragen, Bitte]] I tried the first time to take my notes immediately after I finished reading a chapter. 

## Triggers
I was triggered because I read the book as a paperback version. 
+ So highlighting was not a good option as with the kindle. 
+ Also I could not rely on getting my highlights automatically imported to Obsidian (like with Kindle books)
+ And I know myself and extra willpower required to capture my thoughts after having a whole book finished.

## What I did this time
+ I ==focussed on reading a chapter completely==. To focus on a certain type of work instead of switching reading and writing too fast [^1].
+ I ==worked with one fleeting note== where I extracted my highlights and learnings. Just one note helped me to not get distracted by structuring too much.
+ ==When finished with a chapter I wrote down my highlights from the chapter and added linking== [^2]. The structure was still oriented on the chapters but notes could go everyone in my note. 
	+ And I extracted just items that were highlights and extensions to my current knowledge and projects. I followed the progressive summarisation approach, but by chapter.  [^3]
+ Partially I was not on my computer. So for some chapters I took notes on my Remarkable. This required a 2nd step to get it written to Obsidian. But this was low effort still.
+ I already ==shared first impressions in my digital-garden after finishing chapter==. Following the early sharing approach for my digital-garden
+ When I finished the book, I ran [[Progressive Summarization#2nd pass]] to polish my notes furter

## What worked well
+ It was ==more fun==. I felt to ==accomplish building my second brain== and ==running through a [[Visual Notes | CODE]]== (Capture-Organize-Distill-Express) cycle in ==iterations==. 
+ It removed the *pain* from doing all that work at the end of reading.
+ It ==raised questions early on==. When building connections and externalising thoughts already while reading. These questions shaped reading the next chapters.
+ On my ==Remarkable. To mention the page and just extract the main thought==. So I had a fast jumping point when I then extracted the thought to my smart note.
+ First time working with ==Obsidian Footnotes==. Like that a lot as it makes the text simpler to follow and clean. I still need to level up on properly using Footnotes, but first step taken.

## What is next?
+ I still need to get closer to permanent notes that are smaller and cover one aspect. E.g. the chapter about brainwaves [^4] qualifies for a separate note. 
+ My note taking is still not yet enough oriented on the areas and projects. Maybe I can achieve that by asking this question while building connections.
