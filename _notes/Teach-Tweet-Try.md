The 3Ts that turn my scattered learning into lasting wisdom  
  
Most people collect information.  
  
Some even grow knowledge.Â But then never use it.  
  
Would you follow my claim: Knowledge unused is knowledge wasted?  
  
Please stop reading here if your waste bin is already empty.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
Here's how to turn knowledge into action:  
  
The 3T Method that makes learning stick.  

â†’ Teach a topic  
â€”â€”â€”  
Teaching your learning to others challenges your understanding in so many ways.  
  
I made it routine to build workshops for topics I'm learning.  
  
You have to think about how to explain it clearly.  
  
You create slides, exercises, session structure.  
  
All these activities force you deeper into the topic.  
  
Tomorrow's "Don't Code Hard, Code Happy" session is exactly this.  
  
I'm sharing my current Vibe Coding learning.  
  
Super early stage. Messy. And worth it.

â†’ Tweet/Post - learn in public  
â€”â€”â€”  
I've posted on LinkedIn for over a year. Plus 38 weeks of newsletters. Often sharing half-formed insights from current learning.  
  
When I write about it, I have to organize scattered thoughts.  
Expressing your understanding reveals the missing parts.  
  
Sharing your writing provides meaningful feedback.  
Different opinions. Further experiences. Topic relevance.  

â†’ Try  
â€”â€”â€”  
Apply your learning to real problems immediately.  
  
Just got into Vibe Coding? I built 2 apps instead of just reading about it.  
  
Real projects teach you what theory never could.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
Next time you learn something new, ask yourself:  
â†’ Whom can I help by teaching the topic?  
â†’ What insight can I write about?  
â†’ What can I apply it to?  
  
This way you Express with your learning. You make it stick.  
  
Try it, and I bet you'll experience an immediate difference.  
  
Which of the 3T's will you try first?  

P.S. Pro-Mode: Combine all three T's. The real fun begins when you discover these express cycles compound.
