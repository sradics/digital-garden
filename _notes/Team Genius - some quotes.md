# Team Genius - some quotes

## Importance of Communication

**How team members communicate is just as important a predictor of team success** as several other, highly prized, factors combined—including intelligence, personality, skill, and content of discussions

## Importance of expertics

Collaboration will not compensate for an inadequately endowed team

## Importance of (right consideration) of Diversity

it is not apparent diversity (such as differences in gender, age, or race) that promotes better group performance, but rather **diversity in people’s heuristics, perspectives, interpretations, and predictive models**—all of which are **derived from members’ cultural backgrounds, training, and experience**

The more diverse a team, the more volatile it is likely to be. And often the only thing keeping such a team from exploding is the quality of its leadership.

## Importance of Colocation

the best strategy is, if possible, **to keep team members together through more than one project. That will give them a chance to learn about each other and to bond**—and in the process, help mitigate the social categorization problems associated with diverse teams

## Important team success factors

-   The team **has a compelling direction**: the team task is clear, challenging, and consequential.
-   The team is **bounded** (it is clear who is and who is not on the team) **and stable** (the team’s membership is not constantly fluctuating), and its members are interdependent (that is, they interact with one another to accomplish the team’s work).
-   The team is set up with the right mix of members, who **have norms of conduct that guide their behavior**. Team members are different but not so different that they cannot work with each other. Team members **have the right set of skills and expertise** for the team task.
-   The team has a supportive organizational context that provides team members with **access to resources, information, and training** to help accomplish their task.
-   The team **receives coaching from experts, peers, and leaders**.
