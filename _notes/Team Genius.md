Is your organization, and the teams that compose it, up to the challenges they face in a hypercompetitive global economy?   2.   If not, is there some way to accelerate your understanding of teams?   3.   Can you apply that new knowledge in a way that lets you build teams both fast and appropriately for the ever-changing challenges that face you? — location: [248](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00OG8AXKO&location=248) ^ref-57250

of a team gives us an identity, a bigger purpose, and a way of interacting trustfully with other team members without the wariness and fear we experience with strangers. Thus, the rituals that are established at the formation of a team, and regularly repeated in an abbreviated form thereafter, establish a threshold through which we depart the vast and dangerous real world and enter into a smaller, sacred space where we are safe and surrounded by others who accept us and whom we can trust. — location: [3686](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00OG8AXKO&location=3686) ^ref-18201

luck. Or it could be a dinner, and even a going-away gift, for a longtime or beloved member.

It also creates a distinct and sharply defined closure to that member’s tenure with the team; it ends an era.
