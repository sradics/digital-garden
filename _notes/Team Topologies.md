Organizations that rely too heavily on org charts and matrixes to split and control work often fail to create the necessary conditions to embrace innovation while still delivering at a fast pace. — location: [384](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NSF94PC&location=384) ^ref-2325

But people don’t restrict their communications only to those connected lines on the chart. We reach out to whomever we depend on to get work done. — location: [407](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NSF94PC&location=407) ^ref-48042

That’s why actual communication lines look quite different from the org chart, as shown in Figure 1.1 (see page 6). — location: [408](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NSF94PC&location=408) ^ref-62358

On the other hand, by explicitly agreeing on interaction modes with other teams, expectations on behaviors become clearer and inter-team trust grows. — location: [446](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NSF94PC&location=446) ^ref-53702

---
Design when there is a compelling reason. Develop options for deciding on a design. Choose the right time to design. Look for clues that things are out of alignment. Stay alert to the future. — location: [464](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NSF94PC&location=464) ^ref-36525

---
Periods of technical and product discovery typically require a highly collaborative environment — location: [475](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NSF94PC&location=475) ^ref-34528

---
teams produce software that aligns with customer needs and is easier to build, run, and own. — location: [480](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NSF94PC&location=480) ^ref-58305

It sees the team as an indivisible element of software delivery and acknowledges that teams have a finite cognitive capacity that needs to be respected. — location: [481](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NSF94PC&location=481) ^ref-55126

“Organizations which design systems . . . are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.”6 — location: [489](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NSF94PC&location=489) ^ref-36539

If the desired theoretical system architecture does not fit the organizational model, then one of the two will need to change. — location: [496](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NSF94PC&location=496) ^ref-15525

---
The key takeaway here is that thinking of software architecture as a standalone concept that can be designed in isolation and then implemented by any group of teams is fundamentally wrong. — location: [508](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NSF94PC&location=508) ^ref-13558

Specifically, that is why monoliths need to be broken down (in particular, any indivisible software part that exceeds the cognitive capacity of any one team) while keeping a team focus, a topic we will discuss in depth in Chapter — location: [510](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NSF94PC&location=510) ^ref-34554

However, we hardly ever discuss cognitive load when assigning responsibilities or software parts to a given team. — location: [515](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NSF94PC&location=515) ^ref-57523

Yet having the right team structure, approach, and interaction in place, and understanding their need to evolve over time is a key differentiator for success in the long run. — location: [552](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NSF94PC&location=552) ^ref-17454

Malan reminds us that the organization is constrained to produce designs that match or mimic the real, on-the-ground communication structure of the organization. — location: [604](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NSF94PC&location=604) ^ref-37540

Thus it is important to define “team interfaces” to set expectations around what kind of work requires strong collaboration and what doesn’t. — location: [715](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NSF94PC&location=715) ^ref-10015

Other times, a single tool is used and problems arise because teams need separate ones. — location: [760](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NSF94PC&location=760) ^ref-44526

If we need a clear responsibility boundary between teams, then separate tools (or separate instances of the same tool) may be best. — location: [762](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NSF94PC&location=762) ^ref-46842

Let’s say we need a software development team to work closely with the IT operations team; having separate ticketing or incident-management tools for the two teams will likely result in poor inter-team communication. — location: [764](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NSF94PC&location=764) ^ref-18125

Do we need to change team-interaction modes to enhance how the organization is working? Should we still be building thing X in house? Should we be renting it from an external provider?
