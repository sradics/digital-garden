Things that are complex—living organisms, ecosystems, national economies—have a diverse array of connected elements that interact frequently. Because of this density of linkages, complex systems fluctuate extremely and exhibit unpredictability. In the case of weather, a small disturbance in one place could trigger a series of responses that build into unexpected and severe outcomes in another place, because of the billions of tiny interactions that link the origin and the outcome. In an ecosystem, one slightly mutated virus may spread like wildfire, causing a huge population depletion that, in turn, propagates through the food chain, transforming the local biological order. In the case of economies, the capsizing of a single bank can have no effect at all, or cause cascading failure throughout the system. — location: [1076](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015YVRKPM&location=1076) ^ref-51552

---
Being complex is different from being complicated. Things that are complicated may have many parts, but those parts are joined, one to the next, in relatively simple ways: one cog turns, causing the next one to turn as well, and so on. The workings of a complicated device like an internal combustion engine might be confusing, but they ultimately can be broken down into a series of neat and tidy deterministic relationships; by the end, you will be able to predict with relative certainty what will happen when one part of the device is activated or altered. — location: [1081](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015YVRKPM&location=1081) ^ref-60919

---
Although there are only sixteen balls on the table and the physics is that of simple mechanics, it is almost impossible to predict where everything will end up. In a perfect world, with an impossibly level table, balls that were identical down to the micron, and a player who could strike with the precision of one millionth of a degree, a computer could foresee where the balls would slow to a halt. — location: [1088](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015YVRKPM&location=1088) ^ref-63775

---
However, introduce even the slightest deviation in the trajectory of a single ball, and quickly all the balls that it touches, and all the balls that they touch, will diverge. The density of interactions means that even a relatively small number of elements can quickly defy prediction. — location: [1091](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015YVRKPM&location=1091) ^ref-32393

Because of these dense interactions, complex systems exhibit nonlinear change. — location: [1093](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015YVRKPM&location=1093) ^ref-57512

The strategy always began with cooperating, and then simply did what the other player did on the previous move, cooperating if the other cooperated, defecting if the other defected.

A second round of the tournament was held, and many more entries were submitted. Again, Rapoport’s simple strategy won out.
