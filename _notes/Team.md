If you want a team, you have to give them a home court. — location: [287](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=287) ^ref-17999

---
Is it a fun atmosphere or a rigid one? Do people smile as they work or do they look like they are suffering? — location: [295](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=295) ^ref-11736

---
“If you could have any ‘wish list’ item that would be helpful in bringing departmental success, what would it be and how would it help?” — location: [304](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=304) ^ref-12627

---
to infuse your team with the belief that teammates don’t just work together—teammates are comrades. — location: [324](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=324) ^ref-52903

---
Nothing builds good camaraderie like dinner and a football game! — location: [342](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=342) ^ref-42639

---
casual eating together, and best of all, a deepening relationship that is cultivated between each of them (and their families). — location: [344](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=344) ^ref-13858

---
I’m talking about a relationship that goes deeper than what common courtesy demands. — location: [353](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=353) ^ref-18478

---
Moreover, when your team members experience camaraderie, they will work harder to ensure team success. — location: [362](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=362) ^ref-50500

---
a good team will look to protect, enhance, and praise the work of teammates. — location: [380](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=380) ^ref-27494

---
Instead, be concerned about those people in your ranks who never have another offer come their way. — location: [394](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=394) ^ref-31884

---
because they simply have not connected in a meaningful way with the people they spend the majority of their time with. — location: [398](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=398) ^ref-53442

You see, longevity and camaraderie are linked. — location: [402](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=402) ^ref-36853

Even if you can’t promote them, give them some extra team responsibilities. You want these people to know you notice their contribution. Praise them in front of the team. — location: [405](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=405) ^ref-62374

is, at best, superficial and, at worst, on the edge of meltdown. — location: [447](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=447) ^ref-44163

---

made it a habit to not engage in conversations (in a critical way) with anyone about another member of my team unless that other teammate is right there with us. — location: [466](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=466) ^ref-10919

Slander, gossip, and biting words will fragment and, in turn, ruin your team more quickly than any other thing. — location: [479](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=479) ^ref-37530

---
you became “the great enforcer of respect” for your family. — location: [485](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=485) ^ref-47657

---
However, when your teammates know that they have the respect of those around them, they will work harder and more effectively—respect serving as fuel for their fire. — location: [492](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=492) ^ref-10773

---
tends to be a disease that festers and quickly spreads, if not dealt with immediately and decisively. — location: [497](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=497) ^ref-49464

---
If you only have people on your team who are gratuitous with each other, pasting on smiles, and showing respect but not being respectful, you’ve got nothing more than smoke and mirrors. Respect — location: [528](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=528) ^ref-41279

---
You have to be known to be respected. You have to be respected to be trusted. You have to be trusted to be followed. And you have to be followed to be a leader. Here is a little saying I use frequently: — location: [532](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=532) ^ref-62759

---
Great leaders keep the purpose of their organization in crystal clear focus every single day. — location: [549](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=549) ^ref-45544

When the purpose of the organization is out of focus, energies will be scattered instead of streamlined, causing feelings of frustration, as well as lack of fulfillment — location: [550](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=550) ^ref-11127

---
Are your people “taking the field” with no clue as to what their purpose is and what they are responsible for as it pertains to accomplishing that purpose? — location: [563](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=563) ^ref-16826

---
Are your people “taking the field” with no clue as to what their purpose is and what they are responsible for as it pertains to accomplishing that purpose? — location: [571](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=571) ^ref-16826

---
Once again, it is your job as the team leader to know and clearly state the purpose of your organization as often as necessary—you simply cannot overstate — location: [577](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=577) ^ref-35588

---
The organizational purpose statement of your team must communicate compelling vision and your goals must act as a clear roadmap to accomplishing that vision. — location: [584](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=584) ^ref-63872

---
It involves both why you are doing what you are doing (purpose) and how you will accomplish your stated purpose (goals). — location: [586](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=586) ^ref-33043

---
perhaps, once again—what the purpose of the team — location: [596](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=596) ^ref-13677

---
The second question I ask them is to expand on each of their four goals, giving clarity as to how each will be accomplished. — location: [605](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=605) ^ref-13022

---
If they cannot show me how their departmental goals will ultimately coincide with the overall purpose of the team, some retooling must take place. — location: [607](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=607) ^ref-49543

---
This being said, it is absolutely vital to not only identify the chief purpose of your team, but to point out the individual contributions that each team member has made in accomplishing that purpose. — location: [625](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=625) ^ref-558

---
The people on your team need to know that their efforts are important to the overall success of the team. — location: [650](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=650) ^ref-27062

---
If personal purpose is established, each team member will work harder to accomplish individual and team goals. Clearly articulated purpose is a nonnegotiable — location: [660](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=660) ^ref-10983

---
Highly productive teams are highly motivated teams. — location: [669](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=669) ^ref-59273

---
Great team leaders keep in mind, however, that having stellar employees not only demands hard work on the front end, but ongoing encouragement to keep people working at peak potential. — location: [695](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=695) ^ref-29464

---
Like automobiles, human beings need gas station experiences. We need to be filled up in order to keep moving down Productivity Lane. — location: [697](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=697) ^ref-22198

---
It takes so little to turn someone’s day around. I lean into offices all the time and say things like “Erin, great job this past week. — location: [714](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=714) ^ref-14250

---
but I try very hard to never let a good opportunity for encouragement slip through my fingers. — location: [720](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=720) ^ref-31545

---
encouraging a person on my team who — location: [721](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=721) ^ref-59407

---
has experienced a failure as the result of an idea gone sour and for keeping people from jumping ship during stressful, high-pressure times that are sure to come in any organization. — location: [721](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=721) ^ref-18510

---
When i set a good model of encouragement for those people who serve on my team, they go and do the same for their teams, as well as for each other. — location: [723](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=723) ^ref-49242

---
Many people work on teams where encouragement is conspicuously absent. — location: [737](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=737) ^ref-2781

---
where they are constantly worried about losing their jobs because they never know if they are doing them correctly, — location: [738](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=738) ^ref-5928

---
They suck the energy right out of the room with their downbeat countenance, their beaten down attitude that seems to swirl around them like a dark cloud, and their seeming endless ability to sap otherwise cheerful enthusiastic people of their winsomeness. Negativity should have no place on your team. — location: [744](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=744) ^ref-37689

---
Always take the high road of maintaining the culture of encouragement — location: [748](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=748) ^ref-19458

---
If you have “prickly” people on your team, do yourself a huge favor and focus attention on changing their attitudes. — location: [757](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=757) ^ref-45623

---
A healthy team celebrates every victory. — location: [788](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=788) ^ref-52265

that in reality good work often goes unnoticed while poor work almost never does. — location: [790](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=790) ^ref-13924

What do you do when you see great work accomplished by individuals on your team? 2. What do you do when your team accomplishes a stated goal? — location: [794](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=794) ^ref-30019

---
The difference between the two is that encouragement is something that should be happening along the road to success, while celebration is what you do when you reach your destination (success). — location: [798](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=798) ^ref-53913

---
Celebration, by its nature, brings out the best in everyone and creates a team-driven environment. It actually helps develop the other core essentials (environment, camaraderie, respect, purpose, and encouragement), and effectively builds a highly productive team. — location: [825](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=825) ^ref-50675

---
Failing to celebrate a victory is like leaving the punctuation mark off of the end of a sentence. — location: [840](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=840) ^ref-39014

It falls to you, the team leader, to do whatever is necessary to ensure that the team stays focused and energized. — location: [848](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=848) ^ref-13459

---
Celebration allows a team to forget the difficult problems that are behind them and move forward onto the next big thing—together. — location: [853](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=853) ^ref-30735

---
It is vital that individual achievements be publicly recognized for contributing to the success of the team. — location: [855](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=855) ^ref-44179

---
On the contrary, it is unreasonable to let the significant work of an individual go unrecognized. — location: [861](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=861) ^ref-64017

---
strongly believe that problems should be dealt with privately and successes should be celebrated publicly. — location: [866](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=866) ^ref-17742

During a celebration, all roles disappear. — location: [881](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FENIU0Y&location=881) ^ref-33170
