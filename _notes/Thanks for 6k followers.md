From 3K to 6K Followers: My 100% Growth Journey in 3.5 Months  

â†’ 4 building blocks you might consider too

First of all THANK YOU!  
For your support, guidance, time, thoughts ðŸ’›. 
  
I grew from 3k followers in July to 6k today.  
With 1k new followers in the past month. 
Steady, no bumps, not artificial push.

These four building blocks work for me:
â€”â€”â€”

â†’ Your engagement with others is crucial. 

I commented on 25-50 posts from other authors daily.
I follow up on each comment for my posts.

â†’ I use the connections you can make per week

I send 180-190 connection requests weekly, starting with 25 per day and increasing towards the weekend to max out by Sunday.

â†’ I think about value I can create for my followers. 

Value.Value.Value first. 
I rarely use direct sales posts. 
Instead I embed sales messages inside posts. 

â†’ I show up, daily

Full transparency. It takes time and effort. 
I'm on LinkedIn daily for about 3-5 hours. 
â‡¢ Writing my post early morning takes about 1-2 hours
â‡¢ Followed by publishing + commenting within the first hour
â‡¢ Followed up with comments in a second phase for about an hour.

You might ask: Why am I doing that?
â€”â€”â€”

â†’ Your network is your net worth
â†’ I build my Personal Brand
â†’ I want to develop 
â†’ I love to share

What is your primary goal on LinkedIn?

â€”â€”â€”  
P.S.  
I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease
