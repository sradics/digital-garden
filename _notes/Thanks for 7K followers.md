From 3K to 7K Followers: My 133% Growth Journey in 4.5 Months  
â†’ new: Your comments are my classroom  
  
First of all THANK YOU!  
Your support, guidance, time, and thoughts have been invaluable ðŸ’›.  
  
I continue to rely on my four building blocks, which I describe in more detail here: [https://lnkd.in/e7mXhCyx](https://lnkd.in/e7mXhCyx)  
â†’Â I show up, daily  
â†’ Your engagement with others is crucial  
â†’Â I focus on the value I can create for my followers  
â†’Â I utilize the connections you can make each week  
  
With the recent 1k followers, I've explored new topics:  
  
â†’ Driving engagement with recent connections,  
aiming to strengthen the connection from the start.  
  
â†’ Direct learning from comments  
(see post "Your comments are my classroom": [https://lnkd.in/en6HiUzD](https://lnkd.in/en6HiUzD))  
  
â†’ Using AI to support me with hook lines.  
I usually write and then explore the hook-line that matches my post.  
To leverage AI, I created a hook-line knowledge base and trained AI on it.  
  
Now, I receive hook-line suggestions. Some examples I got for this post:  
â‡¢ I show up daily on LinkedIn. Here's what 133% growth looks like  
â‡¢ Forget 'networking events'. Here's how I gained 4K followers online  
â‡¢ From engagement to 4K new followers:  
The LinkedIn growth hack nobody's talking about  
  
â‡¢ Want 133% LinkedIn growth in just 4 months? (I did it)  
  
I look forward to learning and growing together.  
Thanks for your strong support.  
You rock!  
  
What is ONE ingredient I should experiment with next?

P.S.  
I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease
