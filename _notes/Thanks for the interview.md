How I use Obsidian and my Second Brain for LinkedIn

â†’ Insights on how to get from Idea to a Post

Thanks to Frank for a great exchange about my use of Obsidian for writing daily posts on LinkedIn. 

We covered topics like:

â†’ Using Workspaces for fast setup
â†’ Using visual Maps for Brainstorming
â†’ Maps of Content for High-Level views
â†’ Capturing ideas with Read-Later Apps
â†’ Working with ideas and using ChatGPT to write

I'll link the recording in the comments. 

Have fun exploring our insights about Obsidian and using a  Second Brain. 

Thanks Frank! 
You are such a great interviewer. 
It was fun exploring this world together.
