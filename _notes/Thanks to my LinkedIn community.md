I admit I'm on LinkedIn 2-6h/day  
  
â†’ and sometimes, when in doubt I remember  
  
I started with intense LinkedIn writing 8 months ago.  
  
I wrote daily for 6 months with less traction.  
I struggled with my content format.  
Did not really grow my reach.  
3h daily but low return.  
  
I felt like GIVING UP soon.  
  
I'm an explorer.  
I want to understand things.  
But I was not yet good at one main topic.  
  
ASKING FOR HELP  
  
I learned from great creators on LinkedIn.  
I joined courses, watched tutorials,...  
  
â†’ It helped, but did not yet click for me.  
  
I focused too much on solving that by myself.  
  
All changed, when I joined a community of experts.  
Let by [Nat Berman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanielberman/) and [Darren Mass](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrenmass/).  
With awesome entrepreneurs.  
  
I ASKED FOR HELP  
  
I got it in a day (what I did not find in months)  
  
âž  my missing link: ENGAGEMENT to form relations  
â†³ connections  
â†³ comments  
â†³ DMs  
  
I now engage daily for 2h!  
  
âž  Grew about 1500 followers since.  
âž  Formed great relationships with You.  
  
and âž  I ASK FOR HELP, when I get stuck.  
  
The difference?  
I'm so thankful for YOU!  
Continue sharing your awesomeness.  
  
And please feel inv
