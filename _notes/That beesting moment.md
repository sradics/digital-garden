That "beesting" moment when your boss says:  
  
â†’ "Now I can ask AI about agile. What do I need you for?"  
  
At a Strategic inflection point aka your WAKE UP CALL,  
the choice is simple:  
  
â†’ Stand still and get outpaced  
â†’ Or learn to use AI better and faster than everyone else  
  
In the short video over, I share my 4-step survival strategy:  
1) Become AI proficient (actually USE it)  
2) Externalize your knowledge (get it out of your head)  
3) Build your portable expertise stack  
4) Invest in fast-lane learning  
  
The greatest danger isn't AI replacing you.  
It's someone who learns AI faster than you.
