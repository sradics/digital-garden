## Highlights
* **==Immediately after every lecture, meeting, or any significant experience, take 30 seconds -- no more, no less -- to write down the most important points.==**
* It's not note taking: Don't think, just because you write down everything in a meeting, that you're excused from the 30 second summation.
* It's an act of interpretation, prioritisation and decision-making.
* because we so often, ostensibly, capture everything -- and thus avoid the hard work of deciding what something counts -- that everything is worth less.
* excellence is, of course, the art of elimination. And the 30 second review stops you
* **You must act quickly: If you wait a few hours, you may recall the facts, but you lose the nuance.**
* You learn to listen better, and ask better questions: Once you get into the habit of the 30 second review, it starts to change the way you pay attention,
