# The 5 Models Of Content Curation

**The 5 Models Of Content Curation**

-   Aggregation â€“ the act of curating the most relevant information about a particular topic into a single location.
-   Distillation â€“ the act of curating information into a more simplistic format where only the most important or relevant ideas are shared.
-   Elevation â€“ curation with a mission of identifying a larger trend or insight from smaller daily musings posted online, and adding their own spin on it.
-   Mashup â€“ unique curated justapositions where merging existing content is used to create a fresh and unique perspective on a topic.
-   Chronology â€“ a form of curation that brings together historical information organized based on time to show an evolving understanding of a particular topic.
