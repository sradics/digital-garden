## Content preparation
Storyline:
Since I started my professional career back in 2001 I read 100+ books and each book had an influence on me. But some had an outstanding one. Each of my favorite 9 books implanted a thought, that shaped my behavior and actions until today. 
That is such an important value I gain from reading. Connecting to the rich experience of others and growing my own world of thoughts.  

My 9 most influencial books are:

📖 The Road Less Travelled by M. Scott Peck

📖 Mindset by Carol Dweck
Insight: One can learn anything and growth is possible

📖 How to take Smart Notes by Sönke Ahrens

📖 Radical Candor by Kim Scott
