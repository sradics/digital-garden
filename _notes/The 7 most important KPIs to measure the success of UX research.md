## Highlights

* ==Key Performance Indicators are critical measures of progress toward an end goal.==
* ==Time on task measures== how long it takes for a user to complete a task.
	* The average time on task is usually communicated as the final KPI. The shorter the processing time, the better the user experience.
* ==Use of navigation vs search== indicates the number of people who use the navigation bar, compared to the number of people who use the search functionality.
	* the goal is to understand how users interact with the navigation and search functions of your product and maintain the balance between them.
* ==User error rates== indicate the part of the design that causes the user to make errors.
	* keep track of the parts of the design where the user makes mistakes while completing the tasks you‚Äôve assigned.
* ==Drop-off rates== show how many users abandon the experience. In other words, how many users quit before reaching the end of their goal.
* ==Conversion rates== indicate how many users complete the desired action.
	* Conversion rates are the opposite of drop-off rates.
* ==Effectiveness ‚Äî can users successfully achieve their goals?== 
* ==Efficiency ‚Äî how efficient it is to achieve that goal?== 
* ==Satisfaction ‚Äî was the experience satisfactory?==
* The 10 usability scale questions are: 
	1. I think that I would like to use this product frequently. 
	2. I found the product unnecessarily complex. 
	3. I thought the product was easy to use. 
	4. I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this product. 
	5. I found the various functions in this product were well integrated. 
	6. I thought there was too much inconsistency in this product. 
	7. I imagine that most people would learn to use this product very quickly. 
	8. I found the product very cumbersome to use. 
	9. I felt very confident using the product. 
	10. I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this product.
* ==Net promoter score==
	* Participants rate the question, ==‚ÄúWould you recommend this product to a friend or colleague?‚Äù on a scale of 0 to 10.==
	* ==Promoters== ‚Äî participants who give a r==ating of 9 or 10==, which means they would recommend your product to others. 
	* ==Passive== ‚Äî participants who give a ==rating of 7 or 8==, which means they are satisfied with your product, but they may not recommend it to their friends or colleagues. 
	* ==Detractors== ‚Äî participants who give a ==rating of 0 to== 6, which means they would warn people away from your product or service.
