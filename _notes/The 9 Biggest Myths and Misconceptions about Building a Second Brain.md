## Highlights
* ==when you build a Second Brain deliberately, each technique and tool builds on and extends the others.==
* it’s much easier to:
	* ==Distill and summarize notes with Progressive Summarization if they’ve already been designated as part of a “Project”==
* ==We are liberating ourselves from the neverending details that clutter our minds and freeing up time to pursue a higher purpose.==
* Technology has finally become accessible, user-friendly, and affordable enough that we can take responsibility for knowledge management in our own lives.
* There are as many ways to build a Second Brain as there are kinds of people building them.
* ==The “right” system is the one you stick with and is so easy to use, that it’s simpler to use it than not to.==
* Your habits are unique to you and the unique makeup of your mind.
* your job is to find the spot on that spectrum where you’re most comfortable and capable.
* ==it’s important to experience many models, examples, and case studies of different people’s Second Brains.==
* Their limitation is the ability to turn those ideas into reality. Too many of our best ideas die on the vine, never tasting even a fraction of their potential.
* ==creativity depends on routine.==
* ==Morning habits, exercise habits, journaling habits, reading habits, writing habits, notetaking habits – when creatives practice these habits to the extent that they become automatic, they free up attention to ensure that when inspiration does strike, they have the bandwidth to run after new ideas.==
* Instead, I observe what people are already doing that works, and help them double down on those techniques.
* ==We can choose how we spend our time on our devices.==
* We can choose to direct our attention to the urgent, the sensational, and the shallow. Or ==we can craft our digital environment for learning, experimenting, collaborating, and making things.==
* When you make the shift from consumer to creator, your entire posture toward the world changes.
* Your standards for what information you allow to fill your mind skyrockets, because you need the best to produce the best.
