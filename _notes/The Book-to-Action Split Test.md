# [[The Book-to-Action Split Test ]]

## LinkedIn Post

Same highlights. 2 roles. Completely different value extracted.

I split-tested my Book.To.Action thing

This morning I had the idea to split-test my Book-to-Action system with the same book insights, but two different roles as a starting point.

I took my Building a Second Brain highlights and ran them through two different contexts:

Version 1: Learning Expert developing a 9-week program
â€”â€”â€”
â†’ Result: Complex 4-principle analysis with detailed personal relevance mapping
â†’ Timeline: Multi-month implementation (January-April 2025)
â†’ Focus: How to teach these principles to program participants

Version 2: Busy professional starting a new project
â€”â€”â€”
â†’ Result: Streamlined 3-principle focus with simplified implementation
â†’ Timeline: 30-minute action plan with 2-week full implementation
â†’ Focus: Personal application for immediate project needs

The outcome was fascinating - especially how different the suggested actions were.

Same book. Same highlights. Completely different actionable outcomes.

The insight that hit me:
â€”â€”â€”
Your knowledge system isn't just about capture and organization. It's about the context lens you bring to your information.

The same highlights became: 
â†’ Multi-month transformation vs. immediate relief  
â†’ Teaching framework vs. personal productivity system
â†’ Complex curriculum design vs. simple project organization 

This shows the important to provide your context for the Book to Action approach.

Instead of one-size-fits-all processing, I now ask:
â†’ What's my immediate need?
â†’ What's my current role/context?
â†’ How can I tailor my extraction to match my situation?

The same knowledge, filtered through different contexts, creates entirely different value.

What context are you bringing to your learning right now?

P.S. This experiment revealed something profound about how context shapes knowledge extraction. The detailed comparison shows just how dramatically your starting point influences your outcomes.

P.P.S I'll share the two different Book-to-Action results in the comments
