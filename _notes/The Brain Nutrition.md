This morning 5:45 my wife wondered

â†’ while I told her about Popeye

I was driving the car and brought my wife to the train station.
5:45AM, really early morning, right. 
But still I had to tell her this story:

Imagine
â†’ you balance an AVOCADO on top of your head
â†’ put two BLUEBERRIES in your nose
â†’ DARK CHOCOLATE melting on your tongue
â†’ you massage your temples with OLIVE OIL
â†’ you swallow soaked FLAX SEEDS
â†’ expand the florets of BROCCOLI on each breath
â†’ you do the Popeye SPINACH move
â†’ fingers dusted with golden hue of TURMERIC
â†’ a big WALNUT on you belly button
â†’ you now drink a glass of WATER in one turn

She looked at me like what the heck?!??

I asked her, can you repeat what I just told you?

Can you?

Congratulations! 
You just learned 10 super good BRAIN FOODs.

Happy cooking, happy Sunday!
