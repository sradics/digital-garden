How To Join The Top 1% Of Intelligence  
  
â†’ I'm impressed by [Dan Koe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thedankoe/)'s Guide  
  
"Many smart people are  
lonely, broke, unhealthy, and angry at the world  
  
They can think through complex problems but  
they canâ€™t solve the bigger, more holistic problem  
of living a rich life."  
  
Ouch, that hits heavily. I guess I'm trapped.  
You too?  
  
There is a lot to unpack in Dan Koe's guide,  
but one aspect is my starting point.  
  
"The pursuit of a goal brings order in awareness because a person must concentrate attention on the task at hand and momentarily forget everything else." â€“ Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi  
  
And you might be interested in the  
Five Properties of intelligent systems too:  
  
1) To have a goal.  
â€”â€”â€”  
You store the right information in your subconscious  
Your goal influences your choices  
that compound into achieving that goal.  
â€”â€”â€”  
2) Act toward that goal.  
3) Sense where you are.  
4) Compare it to the goal.  
5) And act again based on that feedback.  
â€”â€”â€”  
The mark of low intelligence is the inability  
to learn from your mistakes.  
  
The mark of high intelligence is the ability to  
iterate, persist, and understand the big picture.  
â€”â€”â€”  

Ok, I get it. It is about setting and following a goal.  
But wait, what goals?  
  
From Ego Development Theory, we get the direction:  
  
HORIZONTAL â€“ Lateral expansion at the same stage.  
Developing new skills and adding information and knowledge.  
  
VERTICAL UP â€“ Transformation.  
Growth to a new stage and perspective.  
  
VERTICAL DOWN â€“ Temporary or permanent regression.  
Due to life circumstances, environment, stress, and disease.  
  
âž âž âž   
Our goal is to reach new stages of vertical-up development  
and not get trapped in the horizontal development rat race.  

I immediately re-defined my goals.  

What do you do?
