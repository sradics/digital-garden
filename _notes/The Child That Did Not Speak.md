How 5 years of childhood silence  
  
â†’ shaped my perseverance and self-belief  
  
At age 4, doctors diagnosed me with a hidden cleft palate.  
  
â†’ My speech had basic limitations.  
â†’ I couldnâ€™t pronounce the letters K, P, or S.  
  
âž  Shame made me STOP TALKING altogether.  
  
I needed two surgeries to fix the issue:  
  
â€” The first removed my tonsils and adenoids.  
â€” The second repaired the cleft palate.  
â€” It took months to recovery.  
  
Recovery wasnâ€™t easy.  
  
â€” I feared speaking.  
â€” I had to relearn basic skills.  
â€” Confidence was a struggle.  
  
It took me WEEKS OF intense TRAINING.  
  
â†’ To drink without spilling through my nose.  
â†’ To pronounce the letters K, P, S.  
â†’ To trust my voice again.  
  
To SPEAK IN PUBLIC at all AGAIN  
  
This experience taught me:  
  
â†’ You can overcome challenges with WILLPOWER  
â†’ To SEEK professional HELP is crucial  
â†’ PATIENCE is a superpower  
â†’ SMALL WINS Matter  
m deeply grateful to my mother for helping me so much.  
For the specialist that discovered the root cause.  
And all supporters in the longer journey.  
  
This profound lesson shaped who I am today.  
  
What was ONEÂ influential learning moment for you?
