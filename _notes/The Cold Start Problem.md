What are network effects, really? How do they apply to your business? How do you know if your product has them—and which other products don’t? Why are they so hard to create, and how do you create them? Can you add a network to your product after the fact? How do they impact your business metrics, at the tactical level? Is Metcalfe’s Law actually right, or should you apply something else to your strategy? Will your network fail or will it succeed? Does your competitor have network effects, and if so, what is the best way to compete with them? — location: [502](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08W2ZSWRL&location=502) ^ref-15490

Network effects are one of the only protective barriers in an industry where competition is fierce, and defensive barriers are weak. — location: [678](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08W2ZSWRL&location=678) ^ref-6724

That means if a network has 100 nodes and then doubles to 200, its value more than doubles—it quadruples. — location: [726](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08W2ZSWRL&location=726) ^ref-47036

These networks often have “sides,” whether they are buyers and sellers, or content creators and consumers. — location: [1076](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08W2ZSWRL&location=1076) ^ref-34044

Generally one side of the network will be easier to attract—this is the easy side of the network. — location: [1076](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08W2ZSWRL&location=1076) ^ref-333

---
However, the most important part of any early network is attracting and retaining “The Hard Side” of a network—the small percentage of people that typically end up doing most of the work within the community. — location: [1077](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08W2ZSWRL&location=1077) ^ref-2146

A small group of drivers, about 5 percent of Uber’s users, — location: [1079](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08W2ZSWRL&location=1079) ^ref-51085

To attract the hard side, you need to “Solve a Hard Problem”—design a product that is sufficiently compelling to the key subset of your network. — location: [1081](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08W2ZSWRL&location=1081) ^ref-58673

but they also need to be chatting away over time. Eventually once they reach a threshold—for Slack it was approximately 2,000 messages—where they’ll stick around and keep using the product: — location: [1121](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08W2ZSWRL&location=1121) ^ref-30817

regardless of any other factor, after 2,000 messages, 93% of those customers are still using Slack today.” — location: [1126](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08W2ZSWRL&location=1126) ^ref-5649

---
The way to answer this is for companies to do an analysis on the size of their networks (on the X-axis) plotted against a set of important engagement metrics (on the Y-axis). — location: [1129](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08W2ZSWRL&location=1129) ^ref-1796

Facebook’s famous growth maxim, “10 friends in 7 days,” is an expression of the same idea. — location: [1132](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08W2ZSWRL&location=1132) ^ref-36038

---
For new products, it’s important to have a hypothesis for the size of your network even before you begin. — location: [1160](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08W2ZSWRL&location=1160) ^ref-48028

Contrast that to products that are highly asymmetrical, with content creators and viewers, or marketplaces with buyers and sellers — location: [1162](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08W2ZSWRL&location=1162) ^ref-17002

Density and interconnectedness is key. — location: [1171](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08W2ZSWRL&location=1171) ^ref-9890

---
The solution to the Cold Start Problem starts by understanding how to add a small group of the right people, at the same time, using the product in the right way. Getting this initial network off the ground is the key, and the key is the “atomic network”—the smallest, stable network from which all other networks can be built. — location: [1175](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08W2ZSWRL&location=1175) ^ref-42167

---
If you can create one stable, engaged network that can self-sustain—an atomic network—then likely you can build a second network adjacent to the first one. — location: [1183](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08W2ZSWRL&location=1183) ^ref-16260

marketplaces do: they aggregate consumers, merchants, and other financial institutions as a multi-sided network. — location: [1198](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08W2ZSWRL&location=1198) ^ref-60725

---
And the bigger the network gets—meaning more consumers, more places where credit cards are accepted, etc.—the more useful the network. — location: [1200](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08W2ZSWRL&location=1200) ^ref-11989

---
The networked product should be launched in its simplest possible form—not fully featured—so that it has a dead simple value proposition. — location: [1231](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08W2ZSWRL&location=1231) ^ref-21762

---
The target should be on building a tiny, atomic network—the smallest that could possibly make sense—and focus on building density, ignoring the objection of “market size.” — location: [1232](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08W2ZSWRL&location=1232) ^ref-58710

---
And finally, the attitude in executing the launch should be “do whatever it takes”—even if it’s unscalable or unprofitable—to get momentum, without worrying about how to scale. — location: [1233](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08W2ZSWRL&location=1233) ^ref-18926
