My LinkedIn engagement strategy I shouldn't be sharing  
  
â†’ 150 authentic comments daily  
â†’ No VA's. Minimal AI. Real engagement  
â†’ Skip the fake tactics. Build genuine connections  
  
Since discovering the high impact of engagement on LinkedIn,  
I've been commenting extensively.  
  
It is about 20-50 comments on posts from LinkedIn contributors.  
And about 50-100 comments on my daily post.  
  
Let me be clear and honest with my commenting strategy.  
  
Not every comment comes with the same intention.  
  
I differentiate comments on other posts in 3 categories:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Supporting my peers in their reach  
(with a mutual agreement to support each other)  
  
â†’ Being genuinely interested in a topic  
When I want to contribute to a discussion and express my point of view.  
  
â†’ A strategic comment to build a connection  
Where I want to raise awareness that I'm present on LinkedIn.  
  
I see this as a less intrusive approach compared to  
sending DMs in the early stages of a connection.  
  
My underlying assumptions (proof yet to be fully experienced):  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ With appropriate comment quality I increase the visibility of me and my content  
â†’ It is a numbers game. More people, higher reach, more potential business.  
â†’ High quality comments increase visibility through several hubs.  
Directly for the one receiving the comment and the ones reading these comments.  
  
But let me say, 50+100 comments take quite some time.  
  
It is about:  
â†’ Reading and understanding a topic  
â†’ Thinking about an answer  
â†’ Providing the answer  
  
30 seconds per comment vs. 1 minute matters  
We speak about the difference of 1h versus 2-3h commenting. Per day.  
  
It is about commenting with appropriate quality and at the same time high throughput.  
  
I don't:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Work with VA's doing the commenting for me  
I don't like the thought that someone writes me a comment, but actually is not the person writing it. It destroys trust. But yet another hack to please the algorithm.  
  
Not my game.  
  
â†’ Use AI for writing my comments  
That is imho a stupid move just to please the algorithm and pollutes.  
Just because we can, does not mean we should.  
  
I do:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Use TypeIt4Me to work with shortcuts for phrases like "have fun exploring"  
Instead of typing 18 characters I just type "hfe" and it expands the text.  
  
Still my thoughts, but typed faster. Like Stenography for taking notes.  
  
â†’ Sometimes use AI to help me with phrasing in better English.  
To compensate my yet missing EN-skills.  
  
â†’ Write a little less intense comments for peer support, where the focus is on extending reach for my peer.  
  
This last one I'm not yet sure about. It is also a part of pleasing the algorithm.  
But what I also observe is that I learn a lot from the insights shared from others.  
  
What's your approach to balancing high-volume engagement  
with authenticity on LinkedIn?

P.S.  
I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease
