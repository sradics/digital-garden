# The Culture of Feedback
I recently joined a very interesting [Coaching Pathway](https://www.coachingbyblinkist.com/) on the topic of Feedback Excellence (I also co-created this pathway and learned by being a participant). And one session in this pathway was dedicated to building a Culture of Feedback in your team and company. 

The model of 4 stages of psychological safety [[#Notes from: 4 Stages of Psychological Safety]] combined 6 great questions to Establish Psychological Safety provide a really powerful tool that can be used by leader to systematically work on nurturing Psychological Safety in their teams.

## Short overview on the 4 Stages of Psychological Safety
+ Stage 1 - Inclusion Safety - **feel included**
+ Stage 2 - Safety to learn, make oneself vulnerable, and make mistakes - **feel safe to learn**
+ Stage 3 - Provide contributor safety - **feel safe to contribute**
+ Stage 4 - Democratize innovation by fostering challenger safety - **feel safe to challenge status quo**

+ Contributor Safety is connected with Situational Leadership - see [[Agile 2 and Leadership#Different leadership approaches]]
+ Interesting connection between curiosity and clarity
	+ it needs a challenger (for too many new ideas) and also the innovator (bringing in new ideas)
	+ connection with Pioneer, Settler, Townplanner

## Short overview on the Six Questions to establish psychological safety

![[Pasted image 20231006152748.png]]

Where to use the Six Questions?
+ from perspective of a team leader - you can build Psychological Safety e.g.
	+ in one-on-ones
	+ in a retrospective
	+ maybe a slack bot - and spontanuous
	+ e.g. in a weekly session - bring in one reflective question
+ just planting the seed and let people answer that over time

## A vale of combining both tools
You can learn about each team members current level of psychological safety and then work with the 6 questions to understand what might be next steps to further establish psychological safety.
### Next action for myself
Actually use the 6 questions to reflect about myself and bring this back to my leads ‚Ä¶ it is also a great tool for self reflection tool

## Notes from 2 Books in Blinks I was asked to read in preparation for the Live Session

Introduction [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/the-4-stages-of-psychological-safety-en?chapter=0)
- It‚Äôs simple: an inclusive environment doesn‚Äôt just happen ‚Äì¬†it takes effort. 
- requires that the team leader or coach provide psychological safety

Chapter 1: To create inclusion safety, make sure team members feel unconditionally included from the very beginning. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/the-4-stages-of-psychological-safety-en?chapter=1)

- le. We tell ourselves that our differences are a reason for conflict, not celebra
- t‚Äôs a way of compensating for things we‚Äôre insecure a
- on. Think about who you include and exclude. Now ask yourself why? What biases or prejudices might be at play h
- ep, ask a close friend or acquaintance about your unconscious bias

Chapter 2: To provide learner safety, create an environment where failure isn‚Äôt just accepted ‚Äì it‚Äôs rewarded. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/the-4-stages-of-psychological-safety-en?chapter=2)
-  because the all-too-authoritarian manager might criticize them
- Learner safety consists of two powerful levers. First, **minimize the feeling that being wrong is bad. And second, minimize the expectation that feedback only happens as punishment.**
- he sees the students as humans, recognizes the immense risk they take by entering the calculus classroom in the first place, and then rewards it
- **is failure punished or rewarded? Do you encourage employees to make mistakes, or are errors a cause for shame?**¬†

Chapter 3: To provide contributor safety, **get to know your team, limit your tell-to-ask ratio, and help colleagues think beyond their roles**. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/the-4-stages-of-psychological-safety-en?chapter=3)

- First, get to know your team‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses. 
- You need to be able to discern whether to trust someone‚Äôs abilities or not.
- here‚Äôs really no need for you to be the one to provide the questions and the answers. Instead, let your colleagues figure it out. **==Listen first==**. And if they seem stuck or are missing something, well, that‚Äôs what learner safety is for! They can ask for help, and you can gladly provide it ‚Äì by talking last.
- share the bigger picture and let your team collaborate.

Chapter 4: Democratize innovation by fostering challenger safety. [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/the-4-stages-of-psychological-safety-en?chapter=4)

- Each unknown can be a source of stress ‚Äì¬†so try to **eliminate as many unknowns** for your team members to make it less stressful to voice criticism.
- concrete steps you can take to encourage challenging the status quo
- encourage dissent from the beginning ‚Äì assign it! **Charge a few people, or everyone, with finding problems in projects, initiatives, or other topics**
- Make sure that less-experienced and less-senior members have a chance to train higher-status employees so they can practice interacting outside of the traditional hierarchy.
- some of your employees might be neurodivergent. This means that they have variations in learning, mood, or attention
- perceiving these variations so that you can recognize which members need what type of safety when
- ensure everyone feels safe to voice constructive criticism without the terror of negative consequences

Chapter 5: Final summary [Source](https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/the-4-stages-of-psychological-safety-en?chapter=5)
- Cultivate learner safety by encouraging and rewarding people for making mistakes and asking questions (remember the calculus teacher!). Get to know your colleagues. **Decide what type of contributor safety they need to participate**, and when it‚Äôs a good idea to provide it. And, finally, remember: **innovation won‚Äôt happen by sticking with the status quo ‚Äì¬†you need challenger safety**. 

### Notes from Courageous Cultures

- If you can‚Äôt use their idea, explain why.¬†

-  ‚Äúsilent wounded.‚Äù They‚Äôve spoken up before and been hurt. Others are the ‚Äúsilent ponderous.‚Äù They‚Äôre quiet because it takes them a while to work out how to speak up
