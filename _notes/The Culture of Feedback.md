# The Culture of Feedback
I recently joined a very interesting [Coaching Pathway](https://www.coachingbyblinkist.com/) on the topic of Feedback Excellence (I also co-created this pathway and learned by being a participant). And one session in this pathway was dedicated to building a Culture of Feedback in your team and company. 

The model of 4 stages of psychological safety [[#Notes from: 4 Stages of Psychological Safety]] combined 6 great questions to Establish Psychological Safety provide a really powerful tool that can be used by leader to systematically work on nurturing Psychological Safety in their teams.

## Short overview on the 4 Stages of Psychological Safety
+ Stage 1 - Inclusion Safety - **feel included**
+ Stage 2 - Safety to learn, make oneself vulnerable, and make mistakes - **feel safe to learn**
+ Stage 3 - Provide contributor safety - **feel safe to contribute**
+ Stage 4 - Democratize innovation by fostering challenger safety - **feel safe to challenge status quo**

+ Contributor Safety is connected with Situational Leadership - see [[Agile 2 and Leadership#Different leadership approaches]]
+ Interesting connection between curiosity and clarity
	+ it needs a challenger (for too many new ideas) and also the innovator (bringing in new ideas)
	+ connection with Pioneer, Settler, Townplanner

## Short overview on the Six Questions to establish psychological safety

![[Pasted image 20231006152748.png]]

Where to use the Six Questions?
+ from perspective of a team leader - you can build Psychological Safety e.g.
	+ in one-on-ones
	+ in a retrospective
	+ maybe a slack bot - and spontanuous
	+ e.g. in a weekly session - bring in one reflective question
+ just planting the seed and let people answer that over time

## A vale of combining both tools
You can learn about each team members current level of psychological safety and then work with the 6 questions to understand what might be next steps to further establish psychological safety.
### Next action for myself
Actually use the 6 questions to reflect about myself and bring this back to my leads … it is also a great tool for self reflection tool

## Notes from 2 Books in Blinks I was asked to read in preparation for the Live Session
### Notes from: 4 Stages of Psychological Safety
#### 4 Stages
+ Inclusion Safety - feel included
+ Safety to learn, make oneself vulnerable, and make mistakes - feel safe to learn
+ Provide contributor safety - feel safe to contribute
+ Democratize innovation by fostering challenger safety - feel safe to challenge status quo

Introduction (https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/the-4-stages-of-psychological-safety-en?chapter=0)
- It’s simple: an inclusive environment doesn’t just happen – it takes effort. 
- requires that the team leader or coach provide psychological safety

Chapter 1: To create inclusion safety, make sure team members feel unconditionally included from the very beginning. (https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/the-4-stages-of-psychological-safety-en?chapter=1)
- inclusion safety, is a prerequisite for everything else.
- acknowledgment that everyone deserves respect and therefore deserves to be included
- on: Why do you choose to include some people and not other
- le. We tell ourselves that our differences are a reason for conflict, not celebra
- t’s a way of compensating for things we’re insecure a
- on. Think about who you include and exclude. Now ask yourself why? What biases or prejudices might be at play h
- ep, ask a close friend or acquaintance about your unconscious bias
- the next stage of psychological safety: the safety to learn, make oneself vulnerable, and make mistakes in the pro

Chapter 2: To provide learner safety, create an environment where failure isn’t just accepted – it’s rewarded. (https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/the-4-stages-of-psychological-safety-en?chapter=2)
-  because the all-too-authoritarian manager might criticize them
- Learner safety consists of two powerful levers. First, **minimize the feeling that being wrong is bad. And second, minimize the expectation that feedback only happens as punishment.**
- he sees the students as humans, recognizes the immense risk they take by entering the calculus classroom in the first place, and then rewards it
- **is failure punished or rewarded? Do you encourage employees to make mistakes, or are errors a cause for shame?** 

Chapter 3: To provide contributor safety, **get to know your team, limit your tell-to-ask ratio, and help colleagues think beyond their roles**. (https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/the-4-stages-of-psychological-safety-en?chapter=3)
- get the opportunity to put their learnings into practice. And for that, you need contributor safety. 

- If you consistently deliver results, you’ll be trusted to do your thing.
- First, get to know your team’s strengths and weaknesses. 
- You need to be able to discern whether to trust someone’s abilities or not.
- here’s really no need for you to be the one to provide the questions and the answers. Instead, let your colleagues figure it out. **==Listen first==**. And if they seem stuck or are missing something, well, that’s what learner safety is for! They can ask for help, and you can gladly provide it – by talking last.
- share the bigger picture and let your team collaborate.
- help colleagues think strategically outside of their own roles. A

Chapter 4: Democratize innovation by fostering challenger safety. (https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/the-4-stages-of-psychological-safety-en?chapter=4)
- last stage is challenger safety,
- Each unknown can be a source of stress – so try to **eliminate as many unknowns** for your team members to make it less stressful to voice criticism.
- concrete steps you can take to encourage challenging the status quo
- encourage dissent from the beginning – assign it! **Charge a few people, or everyone, with finding problems in projects, initiatives, or other topics**
- Make sure that less-experienced and less-senior members have a chance to train higher-status employees so they can practice interacting outside of the traditional hierarchy.
- some of your employees might be neurodivergent. This means that they have variations in learning, mood, or attention
- perceiving these variations so that you can recognize which members need what type of safety when
- ensure everyone feels safe to voice constructive criticism without the terror of negative consequences

Chapter 5: Final summary (https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/the-4-stages-of-psychological-safety-en?chapter=5)
- Cultivate learner safety by encouraging and rewarding people for making mistakes and asking questions (remember the calculus teacher!). Get to know your colleagues. **Decide what type of contributor safety they need to participate**, and when it’s a good idea to provide it. And, finally, remember: **innovation won’t happen by sticking with the status quo – you need challenger safety**. 

### Notes from Courageous Cultures
Introduction (https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/courageous-cultures-en?chapter=0)
- To encourage employees to speak up, you need to **help them feel safe and supported**. (connect to contributor safety)

Chapter 1: In today’s increasingly automated world, creating a **courageous culture is vital for growth**. (https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/courageous-cultures-en?chapter=1)
- However, if managers don’t have the proper culture set up to receive those ideas, the company will squander its most **==valuable asset: the minds of its employees==**.
- Studies show that one in three employees get money from contracts and freelance projects – and just under half of college students said they would rather be entrepreneurs than employees.
- You’ll have: 
	- ***microinnovators*** – people who always look for small but effective ways to make things better, easier, or faster. 
	- ***problem solvers*** – who treat the workplace like their own company and try to find solutions.
	- ***customer advocates*** are always working to meet clients’ needs.

Chapter 2: Replacing a toxic culture with a **courageous** one will **give employees the confidence to share their ideas**. (https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/courageous-cultures-en?chapter=2)
- Why don’t people speak up at work?
	- their managers don’t value innovation and that their ideas won’t have an impact.
	- diffusion of responsibility; they think someone else will say something,
- **“courage crushers?”** These are **toxic behaviors** like **shaming** others for speaking up, **blaming** them when things go wrong, or trying to **intimidate** them when they point out something you don’t want to hear

Chapter 3: Find the right mix of curiosity and clarity, and your employees will reward you with great new ideas. (https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/courageous-cultures-en?chapter=3)
- Find the **right mix of curiosity and clarity**, and your employees will reward you with great new ideas. 
- curious about things, they’re constantly trying to figure out new ways to improve.
- **clarity is when management is transparent about goals, processes, and roles.**
- need to find a balance on the clarity–curiosity 
- building a courage map. Make a timeline of your career, and identify three examples of when you were courageous.

Chapter 4: When managers show gratitude and invite employees to participate, everyone benefits. (https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/courageous-cultures-en?chapter=4)
- What if **bosses were constructive and supported those who offered new ideas**? 
Well, according to one study, people in such companies are **12 times more likely to recommend their firm** as an employer.
- when you have an employee **brave enough to report an inefficient process or a failing protocol, recognize the courage** and time it took them to voice their concern
- If you can’t use their idea, explain why. 
- with a bad idea, coach them through the situation. 
- idea path
- Where do you start? Who needs to get involved? What permissions and processes will it take? By the end, the employee will understand their idea’s life cycle.
- clearly articulating your company’s goals. This will give staff room to innovate with purpose. 

Chapter 5: Don’t just replicate great solutions – instead, tailor their core principles to your work. (https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/courageous-cultures-en?chapter=5)
- How does tailoring core principles of a great idea work in practice?
- teaching their employees to show empathy. 
- create ownership and pride in their employees 

Chapter 6: To build **infrastructure for courage, hire the right people and train them well.** (https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/courageous-cultures-en?chapter=6)
- To build infrastructure for courage, hire the right people and train them well. 
	- “How did you overcome a problem at work?” 
	- “How did you handle a time when you disagreed with your manager?” 
	- “What is the biggest mistake you've ever made?” 
	- “How do you encourage employees when they come to you with ideas?” 
- **Encourage and regularly give feedback**; you might even consider implementing a reward system to promote communication.
- Always **be clear about fundamental values** – and about who is responsible for what.
- Try solutions like encouraging employees and managers to read business books or speak at conferences.
- **skip-level meetings**: events at which leaders interact with employees in junior roles.

Chapter 7: Managers should **create a culture in which every individual feels seen and heard.** (https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/courageous-cultures-en?chapter=7)
- Managers should create a culture in which every individual feels seen and heard.
- But if your employees prefer a more nurturing approach, this hands-off strategy might make them feel like you don’t care about them
-  “silent wounded.” They’ve spoken up before and been hurt. Others are the “silent ponderous.” They’re quiet because it takes them a while to work out how to speak up
- Ask them what their goal is, what they’ve tried, and what happened as a result.

Chapter 8: Final summary (https://blinkist.com/nc/reader/courageous-cultures-en?chapter=8)
- **IDEA approach to check whether what they’re offering is feasible. In this acronym, I stands for Interesting, D for Doable, E for Engaging, and A for Actions**
