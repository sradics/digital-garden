3 workshops, 2 hours, 1 simple process

â†’ How I turned years of expertise into a 3-day workshop in just 120 minutes

Yesterday I drafted a 3-day workshop sequence in just 2 hours:

Day 1 - Networked Thinking and developing strategic competence
Day 2 - Project Management
Day 3 - Time & Self-Management & work organization

I haven't even run most of these sessions yet. 
But creating a detailed draft took me just about 2 hours.

This wasn't luck or magic. It was the result of:
â€”â€”â€”
â†’ Having knowledge building blocks ready to deploy
â†’ Being AI proficient
â†’ Working with an iterative approach

My process was simple but powerful:
â€”â€”â€”
â†’ First draft with AI
â†’ Deep dive into details by scanning my existing building blocks
â†’ Next iteration with AI
â†’ Fine tuning

I see so many professionals struggling with the same challenges you might be facing:
â†’ Information scattered across multiple platforms making retrieval difficult
â†’ Having to redo work because previous implementations were lost
â†’ High investment in courses and books but insights fade quickly
â†’ Feeling overwhelmed by the volume of information to process

To increase your speed to apply knowledge, I recommend:
â†’ Externalize your insights and years of learning 
(through a systematic Second Brain approach)

â†’ Connect your knowledge with AI using proven integration methods

â†’ Iterate between your expertise, AI assistance, and feedback

Imagine accessing your past learnings from different roles, workshops, and experiences within minutes instead of hours. Picture setting up high-quality presentations on familiar topics in just 1-2 hours instead of days.

You don't know where to start? 
No worries. I'm just a comment away.
