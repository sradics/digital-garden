The Ferrari sits in the garage.  
  
â†’ But the road isn't missing.  
  
One year ago, I lost my job at 47.  
The inner voice whispered: "Maybe you're not good enough anymore."  
  
  
Here's what I discovered about that voice:  
â€”â€”â€”  
It wasn't telling me I was failing.  
It was telling me something profound was trapped.  
  
23 years of experience.  
Thousands of problems solved. Patterns recognized. Wisdom earned.  
  
All locked away where neither I nor anyone else could access it.  
  
  
My partially scary evolution:  
â€”â€”â€”  
Strong pivot to Solopreneur.  
(Inner voice: this is scary, after 23 years employment)  
  
I started with my focus on "something" about learning.  
  
evolved from purely Second Brain  
(something you store and process your thoughts)  
  
over adding 4MAT  
(something to look at learning holistically)  
  
to growing a personal learning ecosystem  
(something that integrates mindset, knowledge and AI).  
  
(Inner voice: What a crazy stack is that man!)  
  
  
Here's what happened:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Cohort 01: 20 attendees, 15 paying  
â†’ Cohort 02: Starting July 21st  
â†’ The system works  
  
But here's the thing that drives me crazy:  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
Your decades of experience are sitting in the same garage.  
  
You've navigated complexity that would break newcomers.  
  
You've developed judgment that AI desperately needs.  
  
You've built wisdom that the world is hungry for.  
  
  
Want to see how to unlock it?  
  
  
This Thursday, I'm doing something I've never done before.  
  
A live Behind the Scenes session showing exactly how I built my Idea Explorer AI assistant - the tool that helps me synthesize all this scattered wisdom into something actionable.  
  
You'll see:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ The complete build process step by step  
â†’ How AI becomes your thinking partner (not replacement)  
â†’ Real-time idea development with my creativity coach  
â†’ How to turn trapped experience into accessible wisdom  
  
This is for you if:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ You're tired of brilliant ideas staying stuck in your head  
â†’ You want to see what's actually possible with AI assistants  
â†’ You're ready to transform scattered knowledge into systematic insight  
â†’ You're building something meaningful and need breakthrough thinking  
  
This isn't tech talk.  
  
It's about unlocking the Ferrari that's been sitting in your garage.  
  
  
Ready to see your wisdom in action?  
DM or comment "ðŸ’¡" for details  
Or join directly this Thursday - [https://lnkd.in/eZXMER52](https://lnkd.in/eZXMER52)  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
P.S. Here's how my Idea Explorer introduced itself:  
  
"I'm your creative thinking partner who knows 17 different ways to synthesize and develop ideas. Instead of random brainstorming, I use systematic methods like Cross-Pollination, First Principles Thinking, and Contrarian Synthesis.  
  
My goal? Transform stuck concepts into breakthrough innovations. I don't replace your creativity - I amplify it."  
  
Sound familiar? That's your trapped wisdom, finally free to drive.
