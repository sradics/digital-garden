Systems thinking is a conceptual framework, a body of knowledge and tools that has been developed over the past fifty years, to make the full patterns clearer, and to help us see how to change them effectively. — location: [231](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=231) ^ref-27632

Personal Mastery. “Mastery” might suggest gaining dominance over people or things. But mastery can also mean a special level of proficiency. — location: [235](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=235) ^ref-27293

They do that by becoming committed to their own lifelong learning. — location: [238](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=238) ^ref-58012

Personal mastery is the discipline of continually clarifying and deepening our personal vision, of focusing our energies, of developing patience, and of seeing reality objectively. — location: [239](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=239) ^ref-40645

---
And surprisingly few adults work to rigorously develop their own personal mastery. — location: [248](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=248) ^ref-49335

---
The discipline of personal mastery starts with clarifying the things that really matter to us, — location: [250](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=250) ^ref-53399

Mental Models. Mental models are deeply ingrained assumptions, generalizations, or even pictures or images that influence how we understand the world and how we take action. — location: [255](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=255) ^ref-41385

---
The discipline of working with mental models starts with turning the mirror inward; learning to unearth our internal pictures of the world, to bring them to the surface and hold them rigorously to scrutiny. — location: [269](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=269) ^ref-37448

it’s the capacity to hold a shared picture of the future we seek to create. — location: [273](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=273) ^ref-57038

When there is a genuine vision (as opposed to the all-too-familiar “vision statement”), people excel and learn, not because they are told to, but because they want — location: [279](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=279) ^ref-28294

---
What has been lacking is a discipline for translating individual vision into shared vision— — location: [282](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=282) ^ref-757

---
The practice of shared vision involves the skills of unearthing shared “pictures of the future” that foster genuine commitment and enrollment rather than compliance. — location: [284](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=284) ^ref-45265

When teams are truly learning, not only are they producing extraordinary results, but the individual members are growing more rapidly than could have occurred otherwise. — location: [290](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=290) ^ref-4059

The patterns of defensiveness are often deeply ingrained in how a team operates. — location: [299](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=299) ^ref-26332

A discipline (from the Latin disciplina, to learn) is a developmental path for acquiring certain skills or competencies. — location: [306](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=306) ^ref-9818

What they do not see is the way all the parts work together.” — location: [324](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=324) ^ref-14538

This is why systems thinking is the fifth discipline. — location: [331](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=331) ^ref-51187

---
Without a systemic orientation, there is no motivation to look at how the disciplines interrelate. — location: [333](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=333) ^ref-1566

If nonsystemic thinking predominates, the first condition for nurturing vision is not met: — location: [338](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=338) ^ref-20842

---
But systems thinking also needs the disciplines of building shared vision, mental models, team learning, and personal mastery to realize its potential. — location: [340](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=340) ^ref-50584

The word is “metanoia” and it means a shift of mind. — location: [357](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=357) ^ref-16071

Real learning gets to the heart of what it means to be human. Through learning we re-create ourselves. Through learning we become able to do something we never were able to do. — location: [369](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=369) ^ref-4347

---
Through learning we reperceive the world and our relationship to it. Through learning we extend our capacity — location: [371](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=371) ^ref-6346

to create, to be part of the generative process of life. — location: [371](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=371) ^ref-17946

---
But for a learning organization, “adaptive learning” must be joined by “generative learning,” learning that enhances our capacity to create. — location: [377](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=377) ^ref-16815

The way they are designed and managed, the way people’s jobs are defined, and, most importantly, the way we have all been taught to think and interact (not only in organizations but more broadly) create fundamental learning disabilities. — location: [444](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=444) ^ref-4487

When people in organizations focus only on their position, they have little sense of responsibility for the results produced when all positions interact. — location: [465](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=465) ^ref-46646

2. “THE ENEMY IS OUT THERE” — location: [468](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=468) ^ref-46772

---
The “enemy is out there” syndrome is actually a by-product of “I am my position,” and the nonsystemic ways of looking at the world that it fosters. — location: [475](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=475) ^ref-62342

---
3. THE ILLUSION OF TAKING CHARGE — location: [487](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=487) ^ref-55929

---
But is taking aggressive action against an external enemy really synonymous with being proactive? — location: [491](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=491) ^ref-51737

All too often, proactiveness is reactiveness in disguise. — location: [500](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=500) ^ref-1176

---
aggressive fighting the “enemy out there,” we are reacting—regardless of what we call it. True proactiveness comes from seeing how we contribute to our own problems. — location: [501](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=501) ^ref-27517

---
4. THE FIXATION ON EVENTS — location: [503](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=503) ^ref-49151

---
We are conditioned to see life as a series of events, and for every event, we think there is one obvious cause. — location: [507](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=507) ^ref-39146

---
they distract us from seeing the longer-term patterns of change that lie behind the events and from understanding the causes of those patterns. — location: [513](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=513) ^ref-45921

---
threats to our survival, both of our organizations and of our societies, come not from sudden events but from slow, gradual processes: — location: [517](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=517) ^ref-47874

---
Because the frog’s internal apparatus for sensing threats to survival is geared to sudden changes in his environment, not to slow, gradual changes. — location: [528](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=528) ^ref-60798

---
Learning to see slow, gradual processes requires slowing down our frenetic pace and paying attention to the subtle as well as the dramatic. — location: [536](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=536) ^ref-33481

---
The problem is our minds are so locked in one frequency, it’s as if we can only see at 78 rpm; we can’t see anything at 33-1/3. — location: [539](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=539) ^ref-61086

until we learn to slow down and see the gradual processes that often pose the greatest threats. — location: [540](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=540) ^ref-35154

6. THE DELUSION OF LEARNING FROM EXPERIENCE — location: [542](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=542) ^ref-35288

---
But what happens when we can no longer observe the consequences of our actions? — location: [544](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=544) ^ref-33133

---
When our actions have consequences beyond our learning horizon, it becomes impossible to learn from direct experience. — location: [547](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=547) ^ref-20637

---
we learn best from experience but we never directly experience the consequences of many of our most important decisions. — location: [548](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=548) ^ref-37190

most people have short memories. — location: [554](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=554) ^ref-4151

They institute functional hierarchies that are easier for people to “get their hands around.” — location: [560](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=560) ^ref-48210

analysis of the most important problems in a company, the complex issues that cross functional lines, becomes a perilous or nonexistent exercise. — location: [562](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=562) ^ref-59314

Together, they are supposed to sort out the complex cross-functional issues that are critical to the organization. — location: [566](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=566) ^ref-35355

fighting for turf, avoiding anything that will make them look bad personally, and pretending that everyone is behind the team’s collective strategy— — location: [568](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=568) ^ref-28103

---
joint decisions are watered-down compromises reflecting what everyone can live with, or else reflecting one person’s view foisted on the group. — location: [570](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=570) ^ref-43898

In human systems, structure includes how people make decisions— — location: [823](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=823) ^ref-957

whereby we translate perceptions, goals, rules, and norms into actions. — location: [824](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=824) ^ref-13702

we usually don’t see the structures at play much at all. Rather, we just find ourselves feeling compelled to act in certain ways. — location: [910](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=910) ^ref-22808

just as their orders rose and fell.14 In other words, the players assume that if orders in the game rose and collapsed, this must have been due to a surge and collapse in consumer orders.

In real life, such a situation would, undoubtedly, invite competitors to enter a market and provide better delivery service. — location: [978](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003ELY7OW&location=978) ^ref-23102
