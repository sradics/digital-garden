the common themes we encountered were long hours, high stress and far too little time out of work to get body and mind in balance, never mind achieve personal goals. — location: [218](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=218) ^ref-8781

I feel less stressed. — location: [399](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=399) ^ref-26302

And when you feel less stressed, then what happens? — location: [401](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=401) ^ref-54993

---
‘and’. This tiny word tells another person that you hear and accept what he has just said. — location: [407](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=407) ^ref-35073

---
And when you earn more money, then what happens? — location: [412](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=412) ^ref-13201

---
The first question presupposes that the person’s outcome will be achieved whilst the second marks it as only a possibility, raising doubt. The former helps to guide both the conscious and unconscious mind to fully imagine that the goal has happened, which has a positive effect on the coachee. The Five-Minute Coach includes ‘and’ at the start of all questions, and ‘and when’ at the start of most, in order to deliver this positive impact to the coachee. — location: [414](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=414) ^ref-52535

---
Many people find the word ‘so’ more judgemental in this context than ‘and’, which is more accepting. — location: [422](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=422) ^ref-61742

---
Use your coachee’s precise words within the questions • Don’t introduce any other discussion or dialogue into the coaching — location: [433](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=433) ^ref-10031

It is not your place to offer answers, opinions or advice. — location: [439](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=439) ^ref-53057

---
You have a critical role in creating the conditions for the coachee to reflect and contemplate issues — location: [445](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=445) ^ref-11174

---
As coach, you facilitate others to accomplish things in their own way. As leader or manager, you help to define other’s goals, specify their activity and make them accountable. — location: [450](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=450) ^ref-35866

---
The key to managing potential conflict is to be aware of which role you are in at any point in time.6 — location: [452](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=452) ^ref-28738

---
So when you coach you enable the coachee to create his own ideas and plans, and not comment on them. — location: [455](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=455) ^ref-60385

100 per cent attention and saying nothing for much of the time. — location: [495](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=495) ^ref-53098

---
the precise words you hear. You need to note as many of them down as possible, without changing them, altering grammar or summarising, because you use these exact words in the coaching process. — location: [497](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=497) ^ref-40458

---
quality — location: [499](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=499) ^ref-4620

you detect in the voice? Is there hesitation or ambivalence? Enthusiasm or energy? Frustration or disappointment? — location: [499](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=499) ^ref-22731

---
People’s ability to think deeply and effectively is enhanced by the quality of the attention you pay them.7 — location: [504](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=504) ^ref-52820

---
coaching is that you do not engage your coachee in a dialogue. Your thoughts, ideas and interests are not introduced. Paraphrasing, describing matters as they seem to you or asking questions about things that — location: [514](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=514) ^ref-53816

---
haven’t been explicitly said – all these are for another type of conversation altogether. — location: [516](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=516) ^ref-36749

---
you never ‘help out’ by offering words when the coachee seems to be unable to articulate something. — location: [519](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=519) ^ref-50682

---
You don’t need to rescue the coachee from any discomfort. — location: [521](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=521) ^ref-46518

---
The accurate repetition of your coachee’s words lets her know that you’ve heard her and enables her to hear what she has just said, but from a different perspective. This usually promotes deeper and more useful insights for the coachee. — location: [523](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=523) ^ref-42115

---
You’ll discover how important it is for your coachee to have just the ‘right’ words – the right words for her. — location: [527](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=527) ^ref-47624

---
You insert a coachee’s exact words into a question, only to find that it doesn’t make much sense to you. Worry not – it makes perfect sense to the other person. And, contrary to what you may have learned in school, it is OK to start a sentence with the word ‘and’ — location: [530](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=530) ^ref-9824

---
when you take notes throughout the session. — location: [535](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=535) ^ref-23417

---
At the end of the session hand over your notes to the coachee. — location: [538](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=538) ^ref-64358

---
limiting eye contact with your coachee is a useful tool that eases the process — location: [540](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=540) ^ref-45357

---
The coachee is less concerned with engaging or pleasing you. — location: [541](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=541) ^ref-63806

---
The feeling of pressure to explain everything she says diminishes. She talks to herself as much as – or even more than – she talks to you. — location: [542](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=542) ^ref-7798

---
If you don’t understand what’s just been said, this will be less apparent to the coachee when you are looking at what you are writing rather than at her. — location: [544](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=544) ^ref-27170

---
but you will serve her best if you don’t study her intently. Listen and you’ll quickly notice the way this person’s voice or speech lets you know she’s finished. — location: [547](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=547) ^ref-25947

---
You will detect the signs that she’s finished answering. — location: [549](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=549) ^ref-23214

---
You use encouraging sounds in normal conversation – sounds such as ‘hmm’, ‘uhuh’ and others. Use these in the Five-Minute Coach sparingly – in a way that supports your coachee to feel heard and understood; which in turn encourages more responses. Stick to these sounds, avoiding conversational responses such as ‘OK’, ‘really’ and ‘yes’. — location: [553](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=553) ^ref-2869

---
keep your body communication to a minimum. — location: [556](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=556) ^ref-25813

---
real skill in the Five-Minute Coach through the effective and flexible use of your voice. — location: [560](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=560) ^ref-30664

---
Your tone, for example, demonstrates that you are interested in, and curious about, what the coachee says. Your tone of voice should reinforce the coachee’s statements as if you fully believe them to be true, rather than suggest you are questioning their accuracy. — location: [562](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=562) ^ref-45397

---
Slowing down the speed with which you ask your questions creates the time and space for the words to be heard and reflected — location: [566](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=566) ^ref-38779

(1) Are you the right person?  (2) Is coaching what’s needed? and  (3) Have you agreed a time and place? — location: [577](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=577) ^ref-53662

when information disclosed in a coaching session may cause a conflict of interest. — location: [582](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=582) ^ref-28836

---
anything disclosed in the coaching is not illegal or unsafe. — location: [583](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=583) ^ref-28734

---
If the other person approaches you with an outcome or goal, or she wants to solve a problem, then coaching is certainly a useful route. — location: [588](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=588) ^ref-20592

---
she wants to move responsibility for a problem onto you – looking for you to resolve it, and that is not appropriate – coaching can be useful. On the other hand, if the other person is seeking your expert advice, wants to influence you to think like her or is just off-loading, then coaching is unlikely to be appropriate. — location: [589](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=589) ^ref-16853

---
you come across anything that indicates a need for specialist therapeutic or psychological support, refer the coachee to seek an appropriate service. — location: [593](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=593) ^ref-39446

---
ideally a quiet space, away from other people and free from interruptions. — location: [598](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=598) ^ref-31882

by giving her a choice of seating and — location: [602](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=602) ^ref-48970

---
explain how the process works and what will happen. — location: [603](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=603) ^ref-50193

---
Then ask her where she’d like you to sit. — location: [606](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=606) ^ref-11610

---
Explain that you will not give as much eye contact as usual, nor offer feedback, make comments or suggestions. — location: [609](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=609) ^ref-44661

session to help you to coach her. Explain that you’ll hand them over at the end of the meeting. — location: [611](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=611) ^ref-35567

---
Also, make it clear that once you’ve started the coaching you will not answer any questions. Offer the opportunity for her to raise any concerns she has now. — location: [616](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=616) ^ref-12698

---
In conversation, we often don’t realise we’ve ‘filled in the gaps’ using our own knowledge,8 — location: [643](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=643) ^ref-10337

---
basics of the technique are still essential:  • Use the prescribed Five-Minute Coach questions • Pay attention and listen well • Use the other person’s words • Hold fire with your own advice and thoughts — location: [647](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=647) ^ref-10871

---
Don’t take notes • Maintain good eye contact • Make a mental note of the other person’s words for your next question • Keep your voice tone, volume and pace matched to the other person’s • Maintain the whole experience as a ‘normal’ conversation — location: [658](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=658) ^ref-7943

---
And what would you like to have happen? — location: [680](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=680) ^ref-40772

---
focus your coachee’s mind very clearly on what she wants – an objective or outcome — location: [689](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=689) ^ref-7610

---
And when you don’t want to keep taking work home every evening, what would you like to have happen? — location: [695](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=695) ^ref-44009

---
Your first goal when coaching is to ensure you find out what the coachee wants. — location: [706](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=706) ^ref-32804

---
one problem with solving problems is that it can get in the way of working strategically, proactively and creatively. — location: [714](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=714) ^ref-44746

---
Problem-thinking is sticky! When you think about a problem it’s easy to become stuck thinking about, and around, the problem. If, instead, having noticed the problem, you then change your focus to think about how you’d like it to be – you have an outcome. — location: [721](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=721) ^ref-39003

---
Thinking about an outcome or a goal is like a mental rehearsal. You can’t think about it without imagining and feeling the experience of having it. — location: [728](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=728) ^ref-40308

---
you support them to develop the skills to identify what they want, and get on with doing something about it. — location: [739](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=739) ^ref-41720

---
slowly and deliberately, as this helps the coachee to slow down if he is thinking rapidly, calming the mind to reflect more carefully on what he would like. — location: [748](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=748) ^ref-65279

---
been said describes stopping or remedying the problem, rather than expressing an explicit outcome,10 in the Five-Minute Coach you treat this, and every ‘want’, as an outcome. — location: [752](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=752) ^ref-2562

---
Sometimes it is easier to coach when you know very little about the subject. — location: [760](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=760) ^ref-12865

---
Be aware of showing surprise, horror, amusement or any other emotion in your face and voice tone. Don’t challenge the outcome. If it is unrealistic, your coachee will probably work that out at some point later. — location: [764](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=764) ^ref-49093

---
If, after at least three iterations you still haven’t got an outcome, your second tactic is to focus the coachee with the question: ‘And what would you like instead?’ — location: [797](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=797) ^ref-50919

---
it’s important to persevere and pursue an outcome that describes what a person wants, rather than what he doesn’t want. — location: [812](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=812) ^ref-27546

---
Make sure you work on an outcome that your coachee can do something about. — location: [818](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=818) ^ref-2372

---
If you hear an outcome that you think might be outside the coachee’s sphere of influence, you can check your impression with the ‘And can — location: [819](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=819) ^ref-26766

Pick two days in the coming week where you aim to use the ‘And what would you like to have happen?’ — location: [855](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=855) ^ref-65029

---
Instead of going around and around attempting to analyse a problem, contemplation of what a person would rather have is often enough to start change happening. — location: [881](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=881) ^ref-47916

---
One of the most useful features of this question is that it stops you thinking you know what the other person wants, and then acting on your assumption. — location: [889](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=889) ^ref-54703

---
Attendees gain a shared understanding. It is an invaluable way to improve the effectiveness of a meeting by eliminating assumptions. — location: [895](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008CPIWJG&location=895) ^ref-15732
