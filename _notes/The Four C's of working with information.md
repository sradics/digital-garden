# The Four C's of working with information

1. Consuming  
  
This is where most of us start. Reading books, scrolling socials, watching videos. You’re soaking it all in—but not saving or applying anything. Eventually, you’ll notice: just consuming isn’t enough.  
  
2. Collecting  
  
Now, you’re saving the “good stuff.” Bookmarking articles, jotting down notes. But here’s the catch: saving alone doesn’t lead to results. Your stash grows, but what do you do with it?  
  
3. Curating  
  
At this stage, you’re refining your collection. Distilling ideas, finding patterns, focusing on what truly matters. Progress feels good! But even here, you might wonder: Is this it?  
  
4. Creating  
  
This is the magic phase. You take what you’ve learned and turn it into something new—a post, a video, or a creative project. Suddenly, your ideas aren’t just tools for learning. They’re tools for impact.
