## Highlights
* between 2013 and 2018, completion rates for MOOCs steadily declined, to an average of 3% in 2018.
* The Toolkits – led by companies like Thinkific, Kajabi, and Teachable –
* The toolkits allowed course creators to “rent the infrastructure” needed to accept payments, manage student enrollments, host videos and other materials, and communicate with students.
* ==The fourth wave has taken on the name “Cohort-Based Courses,” referring to a group of learners who join an online course together and then move through it at the same pace.==
	* where ==pre-recorded content is consumed on students’ own time, and the live classroom is reserved for things that can only happen in real time, like coaching, interacting, asking questions, and sharing breakthroughs.==
* There are ==4 elements== that distinguish cohort-based online courses from earlier waves: 
	* **Community** 
	* **Accountability** 
	* **Interaction** 
	* **Impact** Let’s examine
* guidance counselors, study groups, teaching assistants, face-to-face class meetings, student portfolios, and final projects.
* the top CBCs to have ==completion rates of 70-90%,==
* ==vulnerable sharing, amusement and surprise, irreverence and wit, laughing and crying, victory and disappointment.==
* It is ==transformational learning== that cohort-based courses are ideally suited for.
	* ==Learning that shifts people’s identities== so much in such a short period of time that they barely recognize themselves on the other side of it.
* ever more of our time on the Internet, ==there is a tremendous hunger for deeper, more meaningful experiences that stay with us far longer than the latest Instagram story==.
