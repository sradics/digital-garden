## Highlights
Questions to think about with your team: How do your employees define innovation? How do you manage innovation today? Is it centralized? Decentralized? Programmatic/project-driven? Or other? What are the current skills you feel are “innovation” skills? What is not working vis-à-vis your innovation agenda? What are your incentives for employees who work on innovation projects? Are they working? For non-market facing (non-customer facing) innovation efforts, how do you recognize employees for their work? Why do people that volunteer to work on “innovation projects” do so? Are they the right people? Do you have a Chief Innovation Officer reporting to your CEO? If not, why not? If so, what is their scope of influence? Do you maintain a separate budget for innovation? If so, how is it deployed? What is the internal rate of return expected on this spend? Does your innovation group have line of sight directly to the market (i.e., can they go-to-market with their ideas? Or must they sell them through existing business units?) What metrics do you use to track innovation in your company? What processes and methods do you use to inspire new ideas, develop existing ideas, and manage innovation within legacy businesses? Does the world recognize your company as an innovator? If so, how do they talk about you? (e.g. as a product innovator, as a great place to work, for your learning and career advancement opportunities, for the opportunity to participate in the upside of projects/risk-sharing?) What is your plan to develop more general managers earlier in their careers? — location: [445](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009TD4A14&location=445) ^ref-26956
