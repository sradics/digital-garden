[GameChangersMovie.com](https://gamechangersmovie.com/)

[The Game Changers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7455754/) inspired me as a great source about sports and being vegan. I have been to one of the live cinema sessions in Berlin. For me the first time with standing ovations in a cinema.

+ Research your own experience
+ Absorb what is useful
+ Reject what is useless
+ Add what is specifically your own

Animal based has a huge negative impact on the blood function and ability to operate. Heme iron heavily increases risk of heart disease.
+ 40% higher risk of prostate cancer
+ 3x higher risk of colon cancer

Early humans eat mainly plants. And our bodies are also made for plant processing. Carbs helped to develop big brains. Our bodies are not made for meat processing.

B12 must be supplemented by ALL human.

Recovery as most essential elements for sports training. Bouncing back quickly is a huge advantage.

Plant based - rich on antioxidants (46x more). Reduces inflammation measures. Reduces risk of heart disease by 55% and can even reverse heart diseases.

Accelerates healing process.

Higher sexual endurance.

No differences in estrogen levels. (but chicken, diary increase estrogen, cortisol and reduce testosterons)

Meat, diary,... need 83% of the farmland. Animals consume 6x more proteins than what they "produce". Needing huge amounts of waters. 2400l of embedded water for one hamburger. Water pollution. 15% of pollution.
