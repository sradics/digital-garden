## Highlights
I sincerely believe that the only way we can learn is through our deductive process. — location: [73](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=73) ^ref-3636

---
Our textbooks should not present us with a series of end results but rather a plot that enables the reader to go through the deduction process himself. — location: [78](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=78) ^ref-31807

---
Progress in understanding requires that we challenge basic assumptions about how the world is and why it is that way. — location: [99](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=99) ^ref-41175

---
we can better understand our world and the principles that govern it, I suspect all our lives will be better. — location: [100](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=100) ^ref-56607

---
“Well, I can’t say. I think the guy was just so upset he couldn’t think straight. So he screwed it up.” — location: [275](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=275) ^ref-56909

---
What makes me mad sometimes is that I’m always running so hard that—like most other people, I guess—I don’t have time to pay attention to all the daily miracles going on around me. — location: [478](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=478) ^ref-26985

---
He was different a couple of years ago. He was confident. He wasn’t afraid to delegate responsibility. He’d let you run your own show—as long as you brought in a respectable bottom line. He tried to be the “enlightened” manager. He wanted to be open to new ideas. — location: [494](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=494) ^ref-6217

---
“Let me ask you something—just between us: Was your plant able to ship even one more product per day as a result of what happened in the department where you installed the robots?” — location: [608](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=608) ^ref-12121

---
“When you are productive you are accomplishing something in terms of your goal, right?” — location: [688](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=688) ^ref-10210

---
“Alex, I have come to the conclusion that productivity is the act of bringing a company closer to its goal. — location: [691](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=691) ^ref-63923

---
Every action that brings a company closer to its goal is productive. Every action that does not bring a company closer to its goal is not productive. Do you follow me?” — location: [692](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=692) ^ref-7028

---
“Alex, you cannot understand the meaning of productivity unless you know what the goal is. Until then, you’re just playing a lot of games with numbers and words.” — location: [716](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=716) ^ref-45784

reach for my briefcase, take out a yellow legal pad and take a pen from my coat pocket. Then I make a list of all the items people think of as being goals: cost-effective purchasing, employing good people, high technology, producing products, producing quality products, selling quality products, capturing market share. I even add some others like communications and customer satisfaction. All of those are essential to running the business successfully. What do they all do? They enable the company to make money. — location: [853](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=853) ^ref-64383

---
For a moment, I consider going back and telling the supervisor to make those guys actually produce. But, well … maybe there really isn’t anything for them to work on right now. — location: [888](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=888) ^ref-3761

---
“So you need a relative measurement, too,” Lou continues. “You need something like return on investment … ROI, some comparison of the money made relative to the money invested.” — location: [958](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=958) ^ref-36273

---
“You know,” he says, “it is possible for a company to show net profit and a good ROI and still go bankrupt.” “You mean if it runs out of cash,” I say. “Exactly,” he says. “Bad cash flow is what kills most of the businesses that go under.” — location: [962](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=962) ^ref-65032

---
To make money by increasing net profit, while simultaneously increasing return on investment, and simultaneously increasing cash flow. — location: [1015](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1015) ^ref-34602

---
I have found one clear-cut goal. I’ve worked out three related measurements to evaluate progress toward the goal. And I have come to the conclusion that simultaneous increases in all three measurements are what we ought to be trying to achieve. — location: [1017](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1017) ^ref-55255

---
“But where I am, down at the plant level, those measurements don’t mean very much. — location: [1188](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1188) ^ref-8455

---
“There are three of them. Their names are throughput, inventory and operational expense.” — location: [1203](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1203) ^ref-16269

---
“Throughput,” he says, “is the rate at which the system generates money through sales.” — location: [1207](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1207) ^ref-42435

---
“Inventory is all the money that the system has invested in purchasing things which it intends to sell.” — location: [1216](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1216) ^ref-12838

---
“Operational expense is all the money the system spends in order to turn inventory into throughput.” — location: [1219](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1219) ^ref-34908

---
did we sell any more products (i.e., did our throughput go up?); did we lay off anybody (did our operational expense go down?); and the last, exactly what he said: did our inventories go down? — location: [1330](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1330) ^ref-12827

---
Increase throughput while simultaneously reducing both inventory and operating expense. — location: [1336](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1336) ^ref-19995

---
Whenever efficiencies take a drop, everybody draws against the future forecast to keep busy. We build inventory. — location: [1413](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1413) ^ref-48358

---
“Interesting, isn’t it, that each one of those definitions contains the word money,” he says. “Throughput is the money coming in. Inventory is the money currently inside the system. And operational expense is the money we have to pay out to make throughput happen. — location: [1446](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1446) ^ref-16708

---
All employee time—whether it’s direct or indirect, idle time or operating time, or whatever—is operational expense, according to Jonah. — location: [1460](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1460) ^ref-54089

---
“What about lubricating oil for the machines?” asks Bob. “It’s operational expense,” I tell him. “We’re not going to sell that oil to a customer.” — location: [1483](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1483) ^ref-51988

---
“Okay, look, I have to care about efficiencies if only for the reason that my management cares about them,” I tell him. — location: [1650](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1650) ^ref-7148

---
“Most of the time, your struggle for high efficiencies is taking you in the opposite direction of your goal.” — location: [1653](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1653) ^ref-28820

---
“A plant in which everyone is working all the time is very inefficient.” — location: [1665](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1665) ^ref-20427

---
“A balanced plant is essentially what every manufacturing manager in the whole western world has struggled to achieve. It’s a plant where the capacity of each and every resource is balanced exactly with demand from the market. — location: [1685](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1685) ^ref-62716

---
“The real reason is that the closer you come to a balanced plant, the closer you are to bankruptcy.” — location: [1704](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1704) ^ref-37011

---
“Alex, the goal is not to reduce operational expense by itself. The goal is not to improve one measurement in isolation. The goal is to reduce operational expense and reduce inventory while simultaneously increasing throughput,” says Jonah. — location: [1711](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1711) ^ref-38159

---
“For one thing, there is a mathematical proof which could clearly show that when capacity is trimmed exactly to marketing demands, no more and no less, throughput goes down, while inventory goes through the roof,” he says. “And because inventory goes up, the carrying cost of inventory—which is operational expense—goes up. So it’s questionable whether you can even fulfill the intended reduction in your total operational expense, the one measurement you expected to improve.” — location: [1720](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1720) ^ref-45884

---
“Al, it’s not going to work. Even when you’re home, you’re at the office. Sometimes I’ve seen the kids tell you something two or three times before you hear them.” — location: [1804](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1804) ^ref-38890

---
He’s a few feet farther ahead of me than he was a minute ago. So I take some bigger steps to catch up. Then, for a second, I’m too close to him, so I slow down. — location: [1901](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1901) ^ref-2720

---
The line is spreading out; gaps between the boys are widening. Dammit, we’re going to be running and stopping all day long if this keeps up. — location: [1940](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1940) ^ref-55372

---
That’s when I begin to understand what’s happening. Ron is setting the pace. Every time someone moves slower than Ron, the line lengthens. It wouldn’t even have to be as obvious as when Dave slowed down. If one of the boys takes a step that’s half an inch shorter than the one Ron took, the length of the whole line could be affected. — location: [1957](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1957) ^ref-51028

---
Which means that, except for Ron, each of our speeds depends upon the speeds of those in front of us in the line. — location: [1966](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1966) ^ref-65412

---
What’s happening isn’t an averaging out of the fluctuations in our various speeds, but an accumulation of the fluctuations. — location: [1974](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1974) ^ref-13186

---
I’m the last operation. Only after I have walked the trail is the product “sold,” so to speak. And that would have to be our throughput—not the rate at which Ron walks the trail, but the rate at which I do. — location: [1989](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=1989) ^ref-48760

---
So why can’t we catch up at my plant? It feels like we’re always running. We’re running so hard we’re out of breath. I look up the trail. — location: [2174](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2174) ^ref-32651

---
But look at what’s happening: the length of the line is spreading farther and faster than ever before. The gaps between the boys are widening. The closer to the front of the line, the wider the gaps become and the faster they expand. — location: [2196](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2196) ^ref-9183

---
Somebody up there, whoever is leading right now, is walking faster than average, say, three miles per hour. So what! Is his speed helping the troop as a whole to move faster, to gain more throughput? — location: [2201](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2201) ^ref-14352

---
Then I take Herbie by the hand and, as if I’m dragging a chain, I go up the trail, snaking past the entire line. Hand in hand, the rest of the troop follows. I pass Andy and keep walking. And when I’m twice the distance of the line-up, I stop. What I’ve done is turn the entire troop around so that the boys have exactly the opposite order they had before. “Now listen up!” I say. “This is the order you’re going to stay in until we reach where we’re going. Understood? Nobody passes anybody. Everybody just tries to keep up with the person in front of him. Herbie will lead.” — location: [2234](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2234) ^ref-31692

---
“Listen, if you guys want to go faster, then you have to figure out a way to let Herbie go faster,” I tell them. — location: [2250](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2250) ^ref-21774

---
And, remember, the goal isn’t to make the robots productive; it’s to make the whole system productive. Isn’t that right, Lou?” “Well, — location: [2427](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2427) ^ref-12942

---
show them the finished schedule, which looks like this: — location: [2469](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2469) ^ref-5977

---
“Don’t you see? It didn’t matter that Pete got his hundred pieces done, because we still couldn’t ship,” I say. “But Pete and his people thought they were heroes. Ordinarily, we might have thought the same thing. That isn’t right.” — location: [2557](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2557) ^ref-5364

---
“A new computer wouldn’t save us. Data management alone isn’t going to give us more control.” — location: [2588](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2588) ^ref-24279

---
“What we know now,” I tell him, “is that we shouldn’t be looking at each local area and trying to trim it. We should be trying to optimize the whole system. — location: [2610](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2610) ^ref-7605

---
“What you have to do next, Alex, is distinguish between two types of resources in your plant. One type is what I call a bottleneck resource. The other is, very simply, a non-bottleneck resource.” — location: [2615](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2615) ^ref-44166

---
“A bottleneck,” Jonah continues, “is any resource whose capacity is equal to or less than the demand placed upon it. And a non-bottleneck is any resource whose capacity is greater than the demand placed on it. Got that?” — location: [2617](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2617) ^ref-65171

---
Balance flow, not capacity.” — location: [2625](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2625) ^ref-45281

---
“Oh, I see,” says Stacey. “The idea is to make the flow through the bottleneck equal to demand from the market.” “Basically, yes, you’ve got it,” says Jonah. “Actually, the flow should be a tiny bit less than the demand.” — location: [2630](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2630) ^ref-50040

---
“No, bottlenecks are not necessarily bad—or good,” says Jonah, “they are simply a reality. What I am suggesting is that where they exist, you must then use them to control the flow through the system and into the market.” — location: [2637](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2637) ^ref-34087

---
“I guess we look at all our resources,” I say, “and compare them against market demand. If we find one in which demand is greater than capacity, then we’ll know we’ve got a bottleneck.” — location: [2651](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2651) ^ref-36413

---
We’re defining a work center as any group of the same resources. Ten welders with the same skills constitute a work center. — location: [2685](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2685) ^ref-38667

---
Dividing the total of work center hours needed, by the number of resources in it, gives us the relative effort per resource, a standard we can use for comparison. — location: [2687](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2687) ^ref-8767

---
“You know, you just gave me an idea. If we talk to the expeditors. They could probably tell us which parts they’re missing most of the time, and in which departments they usually go to look for them.” — location: [2710](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2710) ^ref-49572

---
“If we’ve got a Herbie, it’s probably going to have a huge pile of work-in-process sitting in front of — location: [2718](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2718) ^ref-16578

---
I had an idea for doing to the plant essentially what I did with the boys on the hike. I thought the best thing to do would be to reorganize everything so the resource with the least capacity would be first in the routings. All other resources would have gradual increases in capacity to make up for the statistical fluctuations passed on through dependency. — location: [2785](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2785) ^ref-30724

---
I say, “Okay, if we can’t do anything to change their position in the sequence, then maybe we can increase their capacities. We’ll make them into non-bottlenecks.” — location: [2795](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2795) ^ref-31654

---
“Alex, I know you’ll do the best you can. If you’ve got these two slow pokes holding everything up, you’ll just have to keep after them and make sure they don’t waste any more time.” — location: [2829](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2829) ^ref-53486

---
From what Alex has told me, your most immediate need is to increase throughput and improve your cash flow. Am I right?” — location: [2862](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2862) ^ref-43304

---
“You mean make them into non-bottlenecks,” says Stacey. “No,” he says. “Absolutely not. The bottlenecks stay bottlenecks. — location: [2869](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2869) ^ref-59612

---
What we must do is find enough capacity for the bottlenecks to become more equal to demand.” “Where’re we going to find it?” asks Bob. “You mean it’s just layin’ around out there?” — location: [2870](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2870) ^ref-55404

---
He asks, “But why should they take their break now instead of when the machine is running?” — location: [2886](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2886) ^ref-23667

---
Your throughput for the entire plant will be lower by whatever amount the bottleneck produces in that time. And that makes an enormously expensive lunch break.” — location: [2894](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2894) ^ref-28843

---
“If it’s still operational, then yes, I might suggest it,” says Jonah. Lou’s eyes blink. — location: [2905](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2905) ^ref-27224

---
Jonah says, “Okay, let me ask you this: are there vendors in the area who can heat-treat parts for you?” “There are,” says Stacey, “but going outside would increase our cost-per-part.” — location: [2922](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2922) ^ref-37977

---
“We’re not sure all the parts in that pile would translate into immediate sales,” says Stacey. “Oh really? You are making your bottlenecks work on parts that will not contribute to throughput?” — location: [2933](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2933) ^ref-47154

---
“Eventually,” says Jonah. “And, meanwhile, how big did you say your backlog of overdue orders is?” — location: [2936](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2936) ^ref-17970

---
I’ll put my question differently: how many products are you unable to ship because you are missing the parts in that pile?” — location: [2940](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2940) ^ref-16885

---
“Can you afford to rule out any possibility,” he asks, “especially one that is as easy to invoke as a change in policy?” — location: [2954](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2954) ^ref-22249

---
“Absolutely not. You can’t make money for long without a quality product,” says Jonah. “But I am suggesting you use quality control in a different way.” — location: [2969](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2969) ^ref-42341

---
ask, “You mean we should put Q.C. in front of the bottlenecks?” Jonah raises a finger and says, “Very perceptive of you. Make sure the bottleneck works only on good parts by weeding out the ones that are defective. If you scrap a part before it reaches the bottleneck, all you have lost is a scrapped part. But if you scrap the part after it’s passed the bottleneck, you have lost time that cannot be recovered.” — location: [2971](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2971) ^ref-62048

---
“You have calculated the cost of operating these two works centers according to standard accounting procedures … without considering the fact that both are bottlenecks.” — location: [2994](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=2994) ^ref-16832

---
“The actual cost of a bottleneck is the total expense of the system divided by the number of hours the bottleneck produces,” says Jonah. “What does this make it?” — location: [3005](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=3005) ^ref-19924

---
“First, make sure the bottlenecks’ time is not wasted,” he says. “How is the time of a bottleneck wasted? One way is for it to be sitting idle during a lunch break. — location: [3012](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=3012) ^ref-14664

---
Another is for it to be processing parts which are already defective—or which will become defective through a careless worker or poor process control. A third way to waste a bottleneck’s time is to make it work on parts you don’t need.” — location: [3014](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=3014) ^ref-49291

---
“Because what happens when you build inventory now that you won’t sell for months in the future? You are sacrificing present money for future money; the question is, can your cash flow sustain it? In your case, absolutely not.” — location: [3017](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=3017) ^ref-63799

---
We positively must do something to improve our due-date performance, — location: [3100](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=3100) ^ref-985

---
“Ralph, I want you to make us a list of all the overdue orders. Have them ranked in priority ranging from the most days overdue to the least days overdue. How soon can you have that for us?” — location: [3108](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=3108) ^ref-37138

---
“Exactly. He couldn’t distinguish between an important batch of parts and an unimportant one,” I say. “Why not?” “Nobody told him.” — location: [3314](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=3314) ^ref-23429

---
“Then the rules had to be broken,” I say. “And maybe they weren’t good rules to begin with. You know we’ve always had to break up process runs for expediency to get orders shipped. The difference between then and now is that now we know to do it ahead of time, before the external pressure comes. We’ve got to have faith in what we know.” — location: [3329](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=3329) ^ref-9067

---
She says, “So what if we simply mark the tags with pieces of yellow tape after the parts are finished by the bottlenecks. — location: [3414](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=3414) ^ref-3272

---
“Good. Let’s do it,” I say. “And, Bob, make sure the people you pick are good. From now on, we put only our best people to work on the bottlenecks.” — location: [3591](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=3591) ^ref-8757

---
I nod. Yes, that sounds like a possibility. With the bottlenecks more productive now, our throughput has gone up and our backlog is declining. But making the bottlenecks more productive has put more demand on the other work centers. — location: [3753](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=3753) ^ref-20661

In this case, Jonah explains, some parts do not flow through a bottleneck; their processing is done only by a non-bottleneck and the flow is directly from Y to assembly. The other parts do flow through a bottleneck, and they are on the X route to assembly where they are mated to the Y parts into a finished product. — location: [3869](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=3869) ^ref-37407

One of them is setup, the time the part spends waiting for a resource, while the resource is preparing itself to work on the part. Another is process time, which is the amount of time the part spends being modified into a new, more valuable form. A third element is queue time, which is the time the part spends in line for a resource while the resource is busy working on something else ahead of it. The fourth element is wait time, which is the time the part waits, not for a resource, but for another part so they can be assembled together. — location: [4298](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002LHRM2O&location=4298) ^ref-29596

For parts that are going through bottlenecks, queue is the dominant portion. The part is stuck in front of the bottleneck for a long time.

One is control; knowing to what extent a company is achieving its goal of making money.

STEP 1. Identify the system’s bottlenecks. (After all it wasn’t too difficult to identify the oven and the NCX10 as the bottlenecks of the plant.) STEP 2. Decide how to exploit the bottlenecks.

(Making sure that everything marches to the tune of the constraints. The red and green tags.) STEP 4. Elevate the system’s bottlenecks.
