You're not behind. You're the secret weapon.

Everyone's panicking about AI.

Younger folks are racing to learn every new tool.

â€”â€”â€”
But here's what they're missing:  
â€”â€”â€”  
You've got 30 years of figuring stuff out.

Of watching strategies fail spectacularly.

Of knowing why that "brilliant" approach everyone's excited about won't work in the real world.

But where is all that wisdom?

Scattered in your head. Buried in old files. Living in stories you tell at coffee breaks.  

â€”â€”â€”
Here's the thing that drives me crazy:
â€”â€”â€” 

You're sitting on a goldmine and don't even know it.

Remember that nightmare project where everything went wrong?

You didn't just survive itâ€”you learned things no textbook could teach.

Like how people actually react to change.  
(Spoiler: not how the books say they will.)

That's not just experience. That's battle-tested wisdom.
