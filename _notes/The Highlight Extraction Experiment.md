# [[The Highlight Extraction Experiment]]
## LinkedIn Post
[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_how-i-rescued-400-book-highlights-without-activity-7310193998109777921-fpCL?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAA1M1pkBgWCYPhT45EpfLiHzViQqRWNCIv4)

How I rescued 400 book highlights without endless typing or scanning.  

That moment when you realized you've highlighted 400 passages in a paper book... a challenge I wrote about yesterday:  
  
[https://lnkd.in/gnxpRhVv](https://lnkd.in/gnxpRhVv)  
  
270 pages with approximately 200-400 highlights. In a paper book!  
  
And I want to transfer my highlights so that I can work with AI building on them (like I did here: [https://lnkd.in/gNKFWWRg](https://lnkd.in/gNKFWWRg)).  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
This is what I came up with:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Took a photo for each page with a highlight (12')  
â†’ All automatically saved to my Google Photos  
â†’ Created an Album (2')  
  
In batches of 10 images:  
â†’ Inserted in a Google Document (2')  
â†’ Added to NotebookLM as source (1')  
â†’ Ask for extracting the highlights (2')  
â†’ Saved as new note in NotebookLM (some seconds)  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
Learnings so far  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ NotebookLM can read Google Documents containing images, analyze them and extract my highlighted passages  
â†’ Sometimes it extracts a little more. I'm fine with that  
â†’ Rarely it skips a highlight. I can live with that too  
â†’ It can't yet process all 140 images at once, but works well with 10-image chunks  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
What you gain  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Speed  
â†’ Highlights that you can now use with AI  
â†’ A Google Doc with all images as reference  
  
Thoughts?
