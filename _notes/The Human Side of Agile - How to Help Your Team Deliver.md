## Highlights
the ATL does not manage and control the work. — location: [679](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091JZSUS&location=679) ^ref-27741

---
Instead, he facilitates the interactions and activities so that the project community can do its work effectively. — location: [679](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091JZSUS&location=679) ^ref-48604

---
Comprehending and embracing the Agile principles,[4] values, and practices > Recognizing that you don’t command or control anyone in your team > Believing that your team will deliver the goods and that your role is to help them > Being inclined and able to lead, nurture, and coach people rather than manage their work > Permitting yourself and others to proceed despite incomplete or changing information — location: [688](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091JZSUS&location=688) ^ref-4557

---
If your organization thinks you are solely responsible for value delivery, it is not implementing Agile properly. — location: [751](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091JZSUS&location=751) ^ref-29685

---
in the Agile framework, you also communicate to the organization what the team needs from it. Communication is now mostly upward. You no longer serve merely the organization; you mostly serve the team. — location: [758](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091JZSUS&location=758) ^ref-38390

---
Rather than maximize their utilization, you support them in working smart and adapting to changing needs. — location: [778](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091JZSUS&location=778) ^ref-21921

---
Reaching out to stakeholders, managers, and advisory boards; maintaining beneficial relationships; and holding conversations that result in useful artifacts — these and other support activities are usually quite time-consuming. — location: [786](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091JZSUS&location=786) ^ref-33489

---
Lack of PO accountability is a serious risk, quite probably the team’s greatest impediment to success. — location: [794](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091JZSUS&location=794) ^ref-39627

---
Bringing them into the project’s kickoff meeting is one of your earliest collaborative, relationship-building steps. Later, invite them to visit the team and attend iteration demos. — location: [816](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091JZSUS&location=816) ^ref-55396

---
In the successful cases I’ve seen, though, every team member knew the sponsors in person, and vice versa. Even basic familiarity strengthens trust and goodwill, which are particularly helpful when the going gets tough. — location: [835](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091JZSUS&location=835) ^ref-25244

---
Maintain a trusting relationship with them: when the road turns rocky, you want them on your side. — location: [846](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091JZSUS&location=846) ^ref-9337

---
Note: If you are a functional or line manager as well as an ATL, you have additional duties (see Appendix). In small, tight-knit environments, it may be fine to play both roles. In larger organizations, though, that would be an antipattern.[6] These roles have different focuses — one is vertical, one is horizontal — while both demand your full attention. Choose one, as you are not likely to succeed in both.[ — location: [866](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091JZSUS&location=866) ^ref-36041

---
Deflect the pressure and keep protecting your team (see 10.7). Allow them space to collaborate, experiment, and correct course. — location: [901](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091JZSUS&location=901) ^ref-25806

But if you’re leading two or more teams, you risk becoming a bottleneck for each one of them. — location: [1084](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091JZSUS&location=1084) ^ref-40517

In most cases, the results were dismal. Those employees had limited opportunity to grow as leaders of Agile teams, and often received poor training. Their existing obligations (e.g., coding) suffered, for two reasons: they no longer had sufficient time for them, and the asynchronous — location: [1107](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091JZSUS&location=1107) ^ref-60418

1. When Alex switches from the Green Team’s project to the Red Team’s, he needs time to catch up on Red’s developments. This isn’t like synchronizing a smartphone; it takes time and often involves asking people questions, thus lowering their output. 2. Inevitably, his bonds with the Blue Team members (and the Red ones, and the Green ones) are weaker. He’s simply not around enough, and when he is, he’s this “expert” they should all listen to. This often translates into reduced collaboration, trust, and knowledge sharing. 3. Alex has no slack time in which to come up with new ideas or simplifications. He lacks the bandwidth to consider that perhaps they should be building other product features. 4. The Blue Team needs him for 50% on average. What happens the week he’s needed for 80%?

In an Agile context, performance reviews cause still-greater harm. Functional managers have little firsthand data about their reports, who spend their time in cross-functional teams.
