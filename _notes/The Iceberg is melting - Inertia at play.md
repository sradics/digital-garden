The Warmest Blanket Is Often The Most Dangerous One

(peek under yours?)

We're facing the most disruptive technology advancement in history.  
One that will transform our workplaces, our lives, in ways we can barely grasp.

The Timeline:
â€”â€”
All points to exponential growth we barely understand.
â†’ Likely we will see AGI this year. "It" gets on par with us.
â†’ Likely we will see ASI this decade. "It" surpasses us.

Yet, I observe INERTIA everywhere.

(Inertia is the resistance to change from an existing state.)

Why are they in This Dangerous Comfort?

â†’ Is it because we don't know where to start?

â†’ Is it because we hope we can just sit and wait?

â†’ Is it because we think this will not continue?

With sit and wait they will heavily end up becoming replaced.
Instead: You can upgrade today. Learn AI, and best, learn with a system.

When you don't know where to start .. let's talk. 

When you think this will not continue. Good luck my friend. 
See you on the other side. 

"Inertia is like a comfy bed - 
it's hard to get out of, but once you do, 
you wonder why you stayed so long!"

From bed to brain -- 3 days left until your Discover your Second Brain workshop
(and prepare for the Third Brain)
