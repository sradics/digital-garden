# The Ladder of Evidence
Generate high value learning in your customer interviews.

## Key takeaways
+ Avoid asking speculative questions (like Why... or What they would do)
+ ==Ask for specific stories from the past==. This creates the richest insights.
+ **Look for evidence of ACTION to evaluate the solution**. Simulate and **let them take action**.

People are telling you much more when you **ask them about a specific moment and share that stories around it** - context, emotions, experiences. Instead of just quick answers with unspecific questions.

**On the top** of the ladder - they replace the question: How do you like ...? And instead **ask the user to take action**. 

==*Ask them to show you what they did*==: Is great when you can compare to an already existing solution (from a e.g. a competitor). Observe them in their real life experience.
