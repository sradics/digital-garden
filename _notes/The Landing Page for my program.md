# [[The Landing Page for my program]]
## LinkedIn Post
[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_im-calling-on-designers-marketers-and-activity-7315614503059021824-CgyA?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAA1M1pkBgWCYPhT45EpfLiHzViQqRWNCIv4)

I'm calling on designers, marketers, and opinionated professionals:  
  
â†’ Tear apart my landing page  
  
I need your brutal honesty on my landing page  
  
After 9 months of work,  
my Learning Ecosystem Mastery program is finally ready.  
  
The promise? Transform from Information Overwhelm to Knowledge Mastery in 9 weeks.  
  
Check it out: [https://lnkd.in/eWFzsQaN](https://lnkd.in/eWFzsQaN)  
  
Now I'm calling on:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Designers  
(is it visually compelling?)  
  
â†’ Marketing Gurus  
(does my messaging hit home?)  
  
â†’ Landing Page Experts  
(what crucial elements am I missing?)  
  
â†’ Opinionated Readers  
(would you click "apply"?)  
  
My burning question:  
Does my landing page clearly convey WHY building an AI-enhanced Learning Ecosystem matters in today's world?  
  
This is me learning in public.  
Don't sugarcoat your feedback.  
Radical candor in comments or DMs - I want it all.  
  
The stage is yours. Tear it apart so I can rebuild it stronger.
