3 days ago, I dropped frustrating parts of working with AI

â†’ with this workflow bridge 99% of knowledge workers are missing

Early morning past Saturday I got it up and running. 
Once again, the diffused learning mode solved some missing puzzle pieces.

Imagine this scenario:

You've taken detailed notes on a topic like "Learning How to Learn." 
You want to explore that topic with AI, leveraging your existing insights. 
After researching with AI, you want to funnel those learnings back to your notes.

Until Friday evening, this meant:
â†’ Copy your note to AI
â†’ Chat with AI
â†’ Copy the output from AI back to your note

I've always hated these copy/paste efforts. 
It's mindless work that wastes valuable time.

To solve this, I connected Langdock with Obsidian, building a bridge between my AI platform and my knowledge management system. 

Now, this means:
â†’ I can pull notes directly from my PKM into AI 
â†’ I can update my notes with AI results instantly 
â†’ No more context switching or tedious copying

An important step toward less friction and more meaningful work.

Happy to share more details if this resonates with you!

P.S. I described The Book-to-Action approach last Friday in my newsletter.
