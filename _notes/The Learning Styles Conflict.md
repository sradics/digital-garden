I discovered why my coworker 'drove me crazy'  
  
â†’ He rushes to build. I need to analyze. We used to clash until...  

He drives me crazy with his rush to "build" instead of doing a proper analysis.  
Each time, he wants to immediately jump into implementation.  
  
In my opinion, we need to understand it first:  
â†’ Look at the data we have  
â†’ Scan for existing examples  
â†’ Understand WHAT we want to build  
  
Our discussions get heated.  
Build it fast or analyze first - who's right?  
  
Then it clicked: We simply have different learning styles.  
  
He's a HOW-learner - learns by doing, with minimal theory.  
I'm a WHAT-learner - need data, facts, and examples first.  
  
Understanding these different styles changed everything.  
Now I see: Each approach has its strengths.  
  
This insight transformed our collaboration:  
â†’ I understand his perspective  
â†’ I can better express my needs  
â†’ We build bridges instead of walls
