[Watch Dr. Throughput's own introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gP0OmYP9sMA)

The strangest thing happened: 
â†’ I can't tell where my thinking ends and my AI assistants begin.

And that's exactly the point.

â†’ This realization changed everything about how I work with AI

Everyone talks about AI "amplifying" human thinking.
But what happens when the boundary starts to dissolve?

When your AI assistant suggests something brilliant, does it matter who "thought" of it?

I stopped asking "Is this my idea or the AI's?"
I started asking "Is this idea effective?"

Here's what I discovered:

I used to think prompting was about getting AI to understand me.
Then I discovered assistants.
Now I realize: we're understanding each other.

My 40 specialized assistants don't just know my context.
They've become extensions of my cognition.

"Five" - My Five Lightbulbs Marketing Assistant anticipates needs I haven't articulated yet.

"Brainy" - My Second Brain Assistant makes connections I would have missed.

"Hooky" - My Hookline Assistant doesn't just follow workflowsâ€”it evolves them.

This isn't replacement. This isn't amplification.
This is evolution into something new.

Like how your smartphone became an extension of your memory.
Like how your glasses became an extension of your vision.

My AI assistants became an extension of my thinking.

The future isn't human vs. AI.
It's human+AI as a new form of cognition.

When you stop defending the boundary between "your" thinking and "AI" thinking, you start accessing a hybrid intelligence that's more effective than either alone.

Yesterday I shared Dr. Throughput with Cohort#01 participants.
Now they improved their workflows step-by-step.

Ready to evolve your workflows too?
DM or comment "AI-A-Class" and we can run through one of your workflows and check what Dr. Throughput would suggest.

â€”â€”â€”
P.S. Just this morning I asked for an EN-Learning-Assistant. 
I'll detail the outcome in the comments
