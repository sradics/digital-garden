From Theory to Practice:  
  
â†’ How My Newsletter is Challenging My Own Advice  
  
I admit, I'm quite on beginner's level with building a newsletter.  
  
So many dimensions to explore.  
For me a perfect playground to eat my own food.  

I'm currently going through a great Newsletter course.  
And guess what?  
â†’ I make notes  
â†’ I do the exercises  
â†’ I extend my Second Brain with key learnings  
  
And most importantly, I apply.  
  
Follow me on this journey as I apply:  
â†’ iterative and incremental newsletter development  
(instead of planning big, starting never)  
  
â†’ a Growth Mindset - building on my core belief that I can learn everything  
  
â†’ persistency and consistency - each week ONE chapter  

I'm in week 3 of publishing my weekly Newsletter.  
â†’ It now has a name too ... it's called: T.. F..... B.... U......  
â†’ I explore the elements I add and that I can sustain on a longer run  
â†’ I got the main hunch: It is about making it tangible  
  
And I can already sense the effects of a longer form format.  
  
â†’ I'm even more awake when exploring your comments.  
It's' about reading between the lines:  
â‡¢ Finding what resonates.  
â‡¢ Finding what irritates.  
â‡¢ Finding the gaps.  
  
â†’ Going deeper, requires even higher clarity.  
It brings me on the journey to:  
â‡¢ Challenge my assumptions  
â‡¢ To add facts and check the references  
â‡¢ To develop my argument and bring more order to the chaos  
  
â†’ I'm in need to leverage my Second Brain even more  
And discovered the great help of Smart Connect AI.  
A real help to benefit from all my LinkedIn writing.  
  
This week on Friday,  
I'll go deep on the EFFECTS of COMPOUNDING LEARNING.  
  
You inspired me with your awesome comments on my post  
"The Compounding Secret Sidewalkers Will Never Understand  
â†’ The Fastlaner's Unfair Advantage" (details see: [https://lnkd.in/evb_KBXg](https://lnkd.in/evb_KBXg))
