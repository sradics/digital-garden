## Highlights
Invest in a good-quality, plumbed-in water filter and replace the cartridge every six months. Jug filters are also good, if you replace the cartridge as instructed. On drink natural mineral water. • Buy organic. When not possible, wash or peel fruit and vegetables. • Never deep-fry foods, and switch to steam-frying instead of sautéeing. • Don’t use cling film unless it states ‘non-PVC’. • Rearrange your daily schedule to minimise time spent in traffic. • Drink alcohol very infrequently, and avoid smoky places. • Avoid medical drugs unless they are the only viable option for treating a health problem. If you get frequent infections or aches, investigate the underlying cause — location: [904](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002TZ3CN6&location=904) ^ref-58546

Vitamins A, C and E are antioxidants: they slow down the ageing process and protect the body from cancer, heart disease and pollution. B and C vitamins are vital for turning food into mental and physical energy. Vitamin D, found in milk, eggs, fish and meat, helps control calcium balance. It can also be made in the skin in the presence of sunshine. B and C vitamins are richest in fresh fruit and vegetables. Vitamin A comes in two forms: retinol, the animal form found in meat, fish, eggs and dairy produce; and betacarotene, found in red, yellow and orange fruit and vegetables. Vitamin E is found in seeds, nuts and their oils, and helps protect essential fats from going rancid. — location: [1018](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002TZ3CN6&location=1018) ^ref-46435

Including vegetables such as tenderstem, broccoli, spinach and avocado in your diet on a regular basis is another great way to up your antioxidant intake. The amino acids cysteine and glutathione also act as antioxidants. They help make one of the body’s key antioxidant enzymes, glutathione peroxidase, which is itself dependent on selenium.
