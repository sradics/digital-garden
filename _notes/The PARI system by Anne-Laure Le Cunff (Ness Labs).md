## Highlights

* But, for our own personal goals, they are not at all appropriate.
* we never ask ourselves if this goal still makes us happy.
* PARI is based on achievable actions
* PACT defines the goal that will be held throughout the PARI system.
* PACT should not focus on the goal but on what can be produced or created.
* Purposeful: Your purpose should be important to yourself and have lasting meaning. It is easier to stay motivated if you spend time on something you care about.
* Actionable: Focus on a goal that you can control yourself, that is not dependent on external factors.
* Continuous: The actions that make up our goal must be actionable and easily repeatable.
* Trackable: It must be easy to follow the actions we perform. Did I do this action today or
* In PACT, there‚Äôs no pressure, no finality. We focus on one action each time and observe the results of that action.
* Act is doing the PACT action defined above. It means blocking a slot in your agenda to hold the PACT.
* React REACT is the personal analysis of your PACT.
* It‚Äôs taking the time out of your week to assess whether your PACT is still relevant, still useful, and beneficial.
* And, my IMPACT happens whenever I dare to publish an article.
* PARI, which is entitled ‚ÄúTurning goals into growth loops: the PARI system of mindful productivity‚Äù.
* The PARI system allows for natural self-improvement and the creation of habits that self-feed personal development loops.
* It is a system that allows you to reach your goals while learning about yourself.
* Finally, comes IMPACT. This is the time to step out of your comfort zone.
