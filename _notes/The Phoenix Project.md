Despite all our hard work and late nights, the competition keeps leapfrogging us. When our Marketing people hear this ad, they’ll go ballistic. — location: [73](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=73) ^ref-26966

We have to do more with less, to simultaneously maintain competitiveness and reduce costs. — location: [75](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=75) ^ref-44018

I have absolutely no interest in becoming one of the VPs who just give each other PowerPoints all day long. — location: [106](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=106) ^ref-45952

I need someone reliable, who isn’t afraid to tell me bad news. — location: [170](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=170) ^ref-16580

You’ve built a reputation as someone who is dependable, pragmatic, and willing to say what you really think.” — location: [172](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=172) ^ref-57488

---
But that’s like throwing gasoline on the fire. Developers are even worse than networking people. Show me a developer who isn’t crashing production systems, and I’ll show you one who can’t fog a mirror. — location: [270](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=270) ^ref-35049

feel better, now that I’ve seen the problem from the business perspective. — location: [288](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=288) ^ref-26661

---
We need to establish an accurate timeline of relevant events. — location: [387](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=387) ^ref-5815

---
And so far, we’re basing everything on hearsay. That doesn’t work for solving crimes, and it definitely doesn’t work for solving outages. — location: [388](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=388) ^ref-2203

“We’ve been meaning to upgrade the SAN firmware for years, but we never got around to it,” Wes explains, turning to me. — location: [407](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=407) ^ref-32265

---
“We came close once, but then we couldn’t get a big enough maintenance window. Performance has been getting worse and worse, to the point where a bunch of critical apps were being impacted. So finally, last night, we decided to just bite the bullet and do the upgrade.” — location: [408](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=408) ^ref-5636

He said he was going on vacation today, which is why the work was so urgent.” — location: [434](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=434) ^ref-24912

The only thing more dangerous than a developer is a developer conspiring with Security. The two working together gives us means, motive, and opportunity. — location: [438](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=438) ^ref-30054

---
They’re always coming up with a million reasons why anything we do will create a security hole that alien space-hackers will exploit to pillage our entire organization and steal all our code, intellectual property, credit card numbers, and pictures of our loved ones. — location: [442](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=442) ^ref-55017

“Ha! Good one, Patty,” John snorts. “I did follow the process. You know what your people told me? That the next possible deployment window was in four months. Hello? The auditors are on-site next week!” — location: [503](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=503) ^ref-5892

---
“That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you. John rarely goes through our change process. Nor do most people, for that matter. It’s like the Wild West out here. We’re mostly shooting from the hip.” — location: [514](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=514) ^ref-520

Get everyone to bring in their changes so we can build a picture of what is actually going on out there.” — location: [531](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=531) ^ref-58308

It’s amazing to me how handoffs between Development and IT Operations always get screwed up. But given the perpetual tribal warfare between the two groups, maybe I shouldn’t be surprised. — location: [598](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=598) ^ref-6655

---
Then you add a bunch of developers who use up all the time in the schedule, leaving no time for testing or operations deployment. And because no one is willing to slip the deployment date, everyone after Development has to take outrageous and unacceptable shortcuts to hit the date. — location: [664](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=664) ^ref-13045

---
He’s right. Unless we can break this cycle, we’ll stay in our terrible downward spiral. Brent needs to work with developers to fix issues at the source so we can stop fighting fires. But Brent can’t attend, because he’s too busy fighting fires. — location: [717](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=717) ^ref-6861

“That software application she made us use is a total piece of crap. It takes twenty minutes to fill out all the goddamned fields for a simple five-minute change! I don’t know who designed the process, but I think they assumed that we all get paid by the hour and want to talk about doing work instead of actually doing work. — location: [798](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=798) ^ref-43354

---
He rolls his eyes. “Look, I’ll tell you right now what’s going to happen. We’ll go to management and present our case. Not only will they say no, they’ll cut our budget by another five percent. That’s what they’ve done for the past five years. In the meantime, everyone will continue to want everything at the same time, and keep adding to our list of things to do.” — location: [950](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=950) ^ref-26808

Wes shakes his head. “I don’t know offhand. I can get the list of business projects from Kirsten, but I’m not sure if anyone knows the answer to your second question. Those don’t go through the Project Management Office.” — location: [961](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=961) ^ref-38684

---
“Exactly. Bonus points if you and Wes can determine which resources are most overutilized and how many new resources we need. That would be the basis of an ask to Steve for more staffing.” — location: [994](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=994) ^ref-25947

With practiced calm, I say, “Okay, knowing is always better than not knowing. Keep going.” — location: [1031](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1031) ^ref-60884

When we reconvene the meeting, I say, “We are not leaving this meeting without a list of authorized and scheduled changes that we’re implementing in the next thirty days. — location: [1102](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1102) ^ref-42746

“You probably don’t even see when work is committed to your organization. And if you can’t see it, you can’t manage it—let alone organize it, sequence it, and have any assurance that your resources can complete it.” — location: [1231](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1231) ^ref-46759

If you stand here long enough, you can actually see all the WIP, that’s ‘work in process’ or ‘inventory’ for plant newbies, make its way toward the other side of the plant floor, where it’s shipped to customers as finished goods.” — location: [1246](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1246) ^ref-17817

---
we now know that WIP is one of the root causes for chronic due-date problems, quality issues, and expediters having to rejuggle priorities every day. It’s amazing that this business didn’t go under as a result.” — location: [1249](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1249) ^ref-51653

WIP is the silent killer. Therefore, one of the most critical mechanisms in the management of any plant is job and materials release. Without it, you can’t control WIP.” — location: [1254](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1254) ^ref-43025

“I suppose to him, it sounds like a reasonable way to pick which job to perform. He’s keeping the first station busy, and it’s similar to first-in, first-out scheduling. But of course, now everyone knows that you don’t release work based on the availability of the first station. — location: [1263](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1263) ^ref-28090

Instead, it should be based on the tempo of how quickly the bottleneck resource can consume the work.” — location: [1265](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1265) ^ref-14374

Theory of Constraints, showed us how any improvements made anywhere besides the bottleneck are an illusion. — location: [1270](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1270) ^ref-33142

---
Astonishing, but true! Any improvement made after the bottleneck is useless, because it will always remain starved, waiting for work from the bottleneck. And any improvements made before the bottleneck merely results in more inventory piling up at the bottleneck.” — location: [1270](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1270) ^ref-53076

Operations is to ensure the fast, predictable, and uninterrupted flow of planned work that delivers value to the business while minimizing the impact and disruption of unplanned work, so you can provide stable, predictable, and secure IT service.” — location: [1283](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1283) ^ref-931

---
“The First Way helps us understand how to create fast flow of work as it moves from Development into IT Operations, because that’s what’s between the business and the customer. The Second Way shows us how to shorten and amplify feedback loops, so we can fix quality at the source and avoid rework. And the Third Way shows us how to create a culture that simultaneously fosters experimentation, learning from failure, and understanding that repetition and practice are the prerequisites to mastery.” — location: [1292](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1292) ^ref-15123

The first ones are the low-risk changes that ITIL calls ‘standard changes.’ — location: [1449](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1449) ^ref-51941

At this level, I care more about the integrity of the process, not so much about the actual changes.” — location: [1457](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1457) ^ref-1318

---
For the ‘messy middle changes,’ we’re deciding that the change submitter has responsibility and accountability for consulting and getting approval from people potentially affected. Once they do that, they submit their change card for us to review and approve for scheduling.” — location: [1458](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1458) ^ref-59713

I nod. “No doubt that this isn’t sustainable in its current form. But let’s get a couple of CAB meetings under our belt and nail down what exactly the rules are. I promise you that we’ll revisit this.” — location: [1470](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1470) ^ref-30531

Those projects certainly represent two categories of work: business projects and internal IT projects. — location: [1565](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1565) ^ref-45860

realize that changes are the third category of work. — location: [1568](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1568) ^ref-53057

Because the stakes are so high, committed tasks are usually reported by the responsible manager as “completed.” No one wants to get on Kirsten’s bad side. Or Steve’s, for that matter. — location: [1583](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1583) ^ref-33677

“If it were me, I’d try to justify it by saying that it would only take a couple of minutes…” Patty says. “Which could be true, but it’s like death by a thousand cuts.” — location: [1653](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1653) ^ref-32209

Maybe some part of him is reluctant to give that up. It does put him in this position where he’s virtually impossible to replace.” — location: [1667](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1667) ^ref-58407

“They’d be responsible for documenting what they learned, and Brent would never be allowed to work on the same problem twice. — location: [1672](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1672) ^ref-47995

---
I’d review each of the issues weekly, and if I find out that Brent worked a problem twice, there will be hell to pay. For both the level 3s and Brent.” — location: [1673](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1673) ^ref-10157

Before I forget, I add, “Wes, I want a timesheet from Brent every day, and I want every escalation Brent works in the ticketing system. We need that documented so we can analyze it later. — location: [1696](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1696) ^ref-6132

Erik had pointed to the ever-growing mountain of work on the plant floor as an indication that the plant floor managers had failed to control their work in process. — location: [1749](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1749) ^ref-13448

But when was the question ever asked whether we should accept the work? And on what basis did we ever make that decision? — location: [1768](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1768) ^ref-23085

---
“And I’d bet a million dollars that this is the exact wrong thing to do. It’s because of this process that, for the first time, we’re even aware of how much scheduled work isn’t getting done! Getting rid of the process would just kill our situational awareness.” — location: [1776](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1776) ^ref-2686

---
“You want me to get my arms around the changes that are heading to Brent, indicating them on the change cards and maybe even requiring this information on all new cards. And to get back to you when we know how many changes are Brent-bound, what the changes are, and so forth, along with a sense of what the priorities are. Did I get that right?” — location: [1784](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1784) ^ref-18486

I continue to listen quietly, but I’m nodding in agreement at his prognosis. In the Marines, we used the term FUBAR, meaning “fucked up beyond all recognition.” — location: [1817](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1817) ^ref-54114

“No, lack of competence is the enemy of good. Mark my words. We’re going to be picking up the pieces for days, if not weeks, because of your dumb decisions.” — location: [1897](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=1897) ^ref-36572

Will I spend the rest of my career doing COBOL maintenance or become just another has-been middle manager?’” — location: [2187](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=2187) ^ref-16861

“It’s like the free puppy,” I continue. “It’s not the upfront capital that kills you, it’s the operations and maintenance on the back end.” — location: [2197](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=2197) ^ref-48909

He continues, “What use is it having all these offshore developers building features if we aren’t getting to market any faster? — location: [2204](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=2204) ^ref-45681

Still, I think it’s important that we get our guys to drop by the party. In order to succeed, we need to create these relationships with Chris’ team. Even if it’s only for a half hour. — location: [2243](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=2243) ^ref-6225

---
Half the time we’re driving in the car, you have this distant look on your face. The rest of the time you’re clenching your jaw, like you’re reenacting some terrible meeting in your head. You never hear what I’m saying, because you’re so preoccupied by work.” — location: [2260](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=2260) ^ref-62279

And yet, for over five years, I was one of the very few people able to maintain any amount of work-life balance. And now that balance is completely — location: [2266](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=2266) ^ref-38640

“Unlike the other categories of work, unplanned work is recovery work, which almost always takes you away from your goals. That’s why it’s so important to know where your unplanned work is coming from.” — location: [2365](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=2365) ^ref-56568

I hope as part of your curriculum, you read The Goal by Dr. Eli Goldratt. If you don’t have a copy anymore, get another one. You’re going to need it.” — location: [2382](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=2382) ^ref-54090

“That means you’re not delivering to the business the full capacity available to you.

“Until we know for sure exactly what went wrong, that’s where I want him. Look, it’s rocket scientists like him that often cause the problem in the first place.

By doing this, we will start integrating security into all of our daily work, no longer securing things after they’re deployed. — location: [4038](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=4038) ^ref-19177

We’re curbing the handoffs of defects to downstream work centers, managing the flow of work, setting the tempo by our constraints, and, based on our results from audit and from Dick, we’re understanding better than we ever have what is important versus what is not. — location: [4078](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=4078) ^ref-47108

Turning around, he says, “In any system of work, the theoretical ideal is single-piece flow, which maximizes throughput and minimizes variance. You get there by continually reducing batch sizes. — location: [4243](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=4243) ^ref-1473

“That means the cycle time of some critical operation in your area of responsibility is greater than the takt time. That is the reason you can’t keep up with customer demand. — location: [4325](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=4325) ^ref-15973

Patty shakes her head. “Are you sure? What about bug fixes? What about performance enhancements when the site grinds to a halt, like what’s happened during the last two major launches? Wouldn’t you love to do these types of changes in production routinely, without having to break all the rules to do some sort of emergency change?” — location: [4411](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=4411) ^ref-37607

Chris thinks for a couple of moments before responding. “Interesting. I would normally call those types of fixes a patch or a minor release. But you’re right—those are deployments, too. It would be great if we could roll out fixes more quickly, but come on, ten deploys a day?” — location: [4414](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=4414) ^ref-43706

blame one another, okay?” Patty says, “You know, this reminds me of something that I’ve seen the plant floor guys use all the time.

the developers and Brent decided to create a completely new database, using open source tools, with data copied from not only Phoenix but also the order entry and inventory management systems. By doing this, we could develop, test, and even run in operations without impacting Phoenix or other business critical applications. — location: [4538](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=4538) ^ref-19736

the end of the meeting, I’m surprised at the unanticipated payoffs of automating our deployment process.

I smile inwardly. For once, it won’t be just us staying up all night because something went really wrong. In fact, it’s the exact opposite. People are staying up all night because everything was going right. — location: [4674](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AZRBLHO&location=4674) ^ref-13077

“Really,” he continues, “patching is so easy, because we can rebuild anything in production with a touch of a button.

Maggie quickly agreed, but it still took the developers two hours to change and deploy. Now, this feature can be disabled with a configuration setting, so we can do it in minutes next time around, instead of requiring a full code rollout.

He stands up, walking over to the window, looking out at the snow-covered yard. “You’ve helped me see that IT is not merely a department. Instead, it’s pervasive, like electricity.
