 I went into a pitch transformer, grilled by 7

â†’ lengthy version in
â†’ short one out

This week I was in a pitch session. 
Everyone had prepared their pitch version.
We were given just 30 seconds to impress.
The group delivered REAL feedback.

What a great challenge!? 
I messed it up the first time. 
Then somehow got my first out. 
Waiting for applause ... got grilled.

Look at my pitch transformation (from - to):

â€”â€”â€” From versionâ€”â€”â€”
Hi, Iâ€™m Sebastian,
I help knowledge professionals learn fast, with impact 
to stay relevant and secure their jobs. 

Imagine mastering new skills in half the timeâ€”how would that impact your career?

My three-stage process 
builds a  strong foundation, 
boosts knowledge, 
and applies it effectively. 

I use AI and a Second Brain approach, 
for high-speed learning and retention.

Ready to learn fast, with impact?

â€”â€”â€” To versionâ€”â€”â€”
Ever had a thought dangle 
on the tip of your tongue, 
just out of reach?

Imagine never needing to chase a thought down again.

I help people 
â†’ LEARN how to learn
â†’ RETAIN and 
â†’ RECALL 
information with ease

â€”â€”â€”

What is ONE thought this sparked for you?
