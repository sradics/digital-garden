I felt isolated in my drive for learning.  
  
It was tough to find like-minded people:  
→ To exchange ideas with  
→ To gain new perspectives  
→ To challenge and be challenged

Then I discovered online communities and joined TWO strong paid ones.

The value I get from communities

Engaged communities care for each other,

Members can try ideas, collect feedback, and expose early thoughts.

## Content preparation
For a longer time I felt isolates with my drive for learning. It was tough to find likeminded people:
* to exchange with
* to gain new perspectives
* to be challenged and challenge

Then I discovered online communities. 
And become a member in two strong paid online communities
+ NessLabs > Main topic: Mindful Productivity > Community Leader: Anne Laure Le-Cunff
+ Brand Built > Main topic: business, branding, networking, and coaching > Community Leaders: Nat Bearman, Darren Mass

Being an active community member influenced my path a lot,

The value I get from communities:
+ Networking with likeminded people. How else can you get exposure to so many different perspective and at the same time all having one bigger uniting topic in mind.
+ Accountability partners
+ Support for each other. In highly engaged communities, it is awesome how people care for each other, provide their insights, lift you up
+ Early stage insights on topics. I love that members have a platform to try ideas, collect feedback. It is a safe space to expose early stage thoughts.
+ Access to collective wisdom
+ I like the on demand possibility to engage. I often zoom in with a community, learn a lot, contribute. Then also have a break just to zoom in a little later again. Because topics are being recorded, discussion threads are accessible I'm not forced to be always online. 

What makes these communities strong for me:
+ Active members
+ Super active community leaders
+ engaging activities - e.g. weekly ceremonies, material shared, courses available, recordings

Thinking  of growing your own community? 
I can recommend Circle.so or Skool as platforms. 
A comparison of both is available in the comments.

Especially for learning I experienced:
+ the importance of accountability buddies
+ the impact of using modern approaches to learning
+ sharing progress, asking for help when getting stuck

A community supports this social aspect and collaborative learning. 

Now, guess what: I'm soon opening the QuintSmart community. 
A vibrant community for fast and effectful learning.
Implemented main insight I gained.

There is a real power in collaborative learning.
