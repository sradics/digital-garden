## Highlights
40 percent of the actions we perform each day are based on habits

> Changing an organization’s direction is a matter of changing its habits.

### 3-Part-Loop
* First, you **sense an external _cue_**
* Next comes the **_routine_, meaning the activity you’re used to performing when faced** with this particular cue.
* Finally, you **get a _reward_ – a feeling of success**

### Craving as driver for habit building
In other words, his brain had begun _anticipating_ the reward. This anticipation is the neurological basis of craving and helps explain why habits are so powerful.

People who manage to exercise habitually actually _crave_ something from the exercise, be it an endorphin rush in the brain, a sense of accomplishment or the treat they allow themselves afterward.

**_don’t try to resist the craving; redirect it_.** In other words, you should keep the same cues and rewards, but **change the routine that occurs as a result of the craving.**

### Keystone Habits
Some habits, known as **_keystone habits_**, are more important than others because adhering to them **creates positive effects that spill over into other areas**.

Keystone habits work by providing _small wins_ – that is, early successes that are fairly easy to attain.

#### Willpower
**Willpower**, it seemed, was a keystone habit that could be applied to other parts of life, too.

A **lack of autonomy also adversely affects willpower**. If people do something because they are ordered to rather than by choice, their willpower muscle will get tired much quicker.


### LATTE - Listen, Acknowledge, Take Action, Thank, Explain
_LATTE_ method, which outlines a series of steps to take in a stressful situation: 
+ _Listening_ to the customer
+ _Acknowledging_ their complaint
+ _Taking_ _action_
+ _Thanking the customer_
+  _Explaining_ why the issue occurred.


Once we become aware of a harmful habit, it becomes our responsibility to address and change it.
