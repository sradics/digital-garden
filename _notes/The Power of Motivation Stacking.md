One person:
A motivation builder


My motivation can heavily vary each day. Sometimes on the edge to struggle with my daily commitments. But you want to hold true to your daily commitments and I found an approach that helps you to stay committed and follow trough.

I stack motivations! And I pin my routines to my higher purpose to that they become rituals with high intentionality.  

2 examples:
My daily morning writing habit is build around getting up each morning 5 o'clock and writing for 2-3 hours. Especially with the recent time shift I can sense the lacking motivation. Time to activate the motivation stack: 
+ Connect to my higher purpose: It is to connect with You and share my experience, to inspire you and build a community around smart learning. Writing is one important step. I know that it builds over time. I know what it feels to be connected. It feels good when I express my thoughts and grow through writing each day. 

My daily exercise routine. Yoga + PushUps + Peloton Cycling. And my motivation especially for the PushUps part can vary really heavily. The motivation stack:
+ Higher purpose - Longevity. Each days investment in strength building, mental fitness and endurance paves my road to stay healthy and be happy.
+ Motivation Stack: Ease into it with Yoga. Feels great, Warms up. Record each days progress and be patient to accept a plateau. I love my progress badges and small celebrations. E.g breaking through my 200 4 minute pushup limit, reach each months 3000 minute exercise goals. Especially Peloton does that really well. I know what it feels like after the exercise. I'm in good mood, muscles and brain activated, ready to conquer the day.

What is your motivation stack?
