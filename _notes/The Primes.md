The LEADING PRIME defines the act of leading as setting direction, allocating resources, and inspiring action. — location: [408](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007KSTVNC&location=408) ^ref-7120

---
Leader: A title Manager: A title Operator: A title These three words convey what people are. They do not dictate or even indicate what a person of any given title actually does. Now let's look at three verbs: Leading: Setting direction, allocating — location: [411](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007KSTVNC&location=411) ^ref-54792

When you spend your time doing what the business does, you are not leading. — location: [426](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007KSTVNC&location=426) ^ref-12435

---
Even when you spend your time making your business more efficient, you are managing, not leading, your business. — location: [426](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007KSTVNC&location=426) ^ref-38553

---
This type of work is more certain and less risky. Leading is ambiguous and offers terrific opportunity to look bad in front of others. — location: [429](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007KSTVNC&location=429) ^ref-33698

When working IN your business, you operate the systems and solve the problems that already exist. — location: [447](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007KSTVNC&location=447) ^ref-8074

---
When you work ON your business, your activities either change or transform it; you bring forth new ways for the business to operate and produce extraordinary results (or failure) in the market. — location: [448](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007KSTVNC&location=448) ^ref-51724

IN is seductive, whereas ON is ambiguous and scary. — location: [462](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007KSTVNC&location=462) ^ref-28596

excuses to avoid the relatively ambiguous responsibility of leading change. — location: [482](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007KSTVNC&location=482) ^ref-33981

I've concluded that the failure to recognize the distinction between IN and ON—mismanagement of the critical allocation of time and attention to each—is the number one reason why change and transformation efforts fail. — location: [488](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007KSTVNC&location=488) ^ref-7842

Does solving your problem require CHANGE or TRANSFORMATION? — location: [508](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007KSTVNC&location=508) ^ref-31709

---
CHANGE is the right path when a problem is relatively simple and the current system needs only a tune-up. TRANSFORMATION is the right path when problems are “wicked” and a completely new system is required. Mastery begins by choosing the right path. — location: [509](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007KSTVNC&location=509) ^ref-31867

When we choose change, our future is really a reconditioned or improved version of the past. — location: [514](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007KSTVNC&location=514) ^ref-60426

TRANSFORMATION involves a break with the past that is traumatic — location: [515](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007KSTVNC&location=515) ^ref-1815

and invent ways to bring it into reality. Transformation doesn't describe our future by referencing the past (better, faster, or cheaper); it births a future that is entirely new. — location: [516](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007KSTVNC&location=516) ^ref-25271

---
Is it about making a better, faster, cheaper past, or committing to fulfill a declaration and create a future? — location: [545](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007KSTVNC&location=545) ^ref-54504

The instruments of transformation are imagination, declaration, invention, — location: [552](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007KSTVNC&location=552) ^ref-23937

In the context of the PRIMES, INTEGRITY means, “I say what I am going to do, and I do what I say…every time. — location: [616](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007KSTVNC&location=616) ^ref-17525

But many groups you will be leading and of which you're a member are more like coalitions. — location: [758](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007KSTVNC&location=758) ^ref-43442

DYNAMIC INCOMPLETENESS adheres to the truth that too much form causes resistance and too much void causes chaos. The leader's job is to bring just enough form to inspire the people and frame what needs to be articulated. In a nutshell, that is the art of visioning. — location: [792](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007KSTVNC&location=792) ^ref-45830

Visions that ennoble begin by painting a picture of the world at large and the community your business serves. This picture is a present-tense description of a desired future state.

Initially, LAGGARDS are difficult to distinguish from Early Adopters. They too ask good questions when presented with a change or new way of doing things. They are often well prepared and smart.

There are only three ways to make the best choice when faced with such a RIGHT versus RIGHT dilemma: 1. End-based: Select the option that generates the most good for the most people. 2.

When we CHASE innovation, we LOSE innovation.

CHASE a meaningful outcome. Deal quickly with whatever puts that outcome at risk by quickly intervening to teach a best practice or stop a destructive practice.

As program managers for the Quicksilver project, we never CHASED any direct team-building, leadership development, or innovation practices. We didn't host any workshops to facilitate CULTURE creation. We simply dealt immediately with anything that put the outcome at risk. CHASE–LOSE sets the right order to things: First, answer the call and respond to big challenges. Next, enroll others and declare your intentions with integrity. Then, get busy and work as quickly as possible. Finally, deal quickly with anything that threatens success. — location: [2463](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007KSTVNC&location=2463) ^ref-51403

you work with a group that has more than seven participants, someone has to facilitate the process. And whoever takes responsibility for facilitating the process must surrender his or her right to offer content. — location: [2482](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007KSTVNC&location=2482) ^ref-38176

The reason for this is simple: If you are running the process and have a stake in the outcome, you will manipulate the process to get your outcome.

Distinguish between collaboration with the group and a command-and-control relationship. Master the best practices of each. 2. Intentionally and explicitly choose one role or the other in any given situation. 3. Don't shift from one role to another. Forewarn the group explicitly if you must shift—typically from collaboration to command and control. Remember, it's almost impossible to return to collaboration once the shift to command and control has been made. 4. Don't shift relationships with group members during the course of any single meeting. Collaborate with them one day but resist the temptation to make any decisions or pass unilateral judgment on a particular idea. Collaboration typically generates recommendations as opposed to decisions. After careful consideration of the recommendations, use your organizational authority on a later day to make a decision. — location: [2530](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007KSTVNC&location=2530) ^ref-29117

For those who choose, there are three convenient places to hide out so that you can fail to produce your declared outcome but not get blamed.

Change has a considerable psychological impact on the human mind. To the fearful it is threatening because it means things may get worse.

“Is there anything obvious that we could take on now to get this transformation started?” People were flustered. They said, “We are only on the first day of this planning process. It is too early to take an action.” We asked them, “How long have each of you lived and worked in DC?” Collectively, the number was over 500 years. And so we replied, “We have 500 years of experience and dozens of recent studies. When you close your eyes and imagine DC, isn't there anything obvious, no matter how much longer we study it, that we simply must do now? — location: [2602](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007KSTVNC&location=2602) ^ref-36190

“What is our plan for next month and what are we currently projecting?” This question leads to the question “What do we have to do now to close the gap between our plan and our projection?” — location: [2773](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007KSTVNC&location=2773) ^ref-56578

Plan: What we intend to make happen at a specific time in the future. Projection: What we think is really going to happen at a specific time unless we do something different.

You are attached if you become angry because you did not fulfill your DECLARATION. People who get attached to things allow those things to determine their feelings. Solving problems, driving change, and causing transformation are fraught with variables—unexpected risks and developments that are outside your control. Getting attached to outcomes means that you relinquish control of your way of being—and you will burn out in this business. So commit to outcomes, live unreasonably, and do everything you can to deliver the outcome on time.
