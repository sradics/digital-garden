I openly acknowledged that these were challenging issues. I candidly shared the thinking and rationale behind the decisions and the process by which they were made, or were being made. I shared all the data I could share, and if I couldn’t share it, I explained why.

First, I learned that I had assumed way too much. I assumed I had trust with people, when in fact I didn’t. I assumed that people were aware of my track record and Covey Leadership Center’s track record, which they were not. I assumed that because I was teeing up the tough issues in my private meetings and making decisions based on objective business criteria, this was being reported down line, but it was not. — location: [540](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000MGATWG&location=540) ^ref-840

“Widespread distrust in a society . . . imposes a kind of tax on all forms of economic activity, a tax that high-trust societies do not have to pay.” — location: [709](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000MGATWG&location=709) ^ref-39269

Trust is hard. It’s real. It’s quantifiable. It’s measurable. In every instance, it affects both speed and cost, and speed and cost can be measured and quantified. — location: [862](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000MGATWG&location=862) ^ref-6315

Years ago as a young mother, I read an article entitled “Can Your Child Trust You?” The author pointed out how, as parents, we will often tell a young child “no!” over and over instead of following through in meaningful ways to ensure that he obeys the first time. As a result, children learn that if they — location: [1264](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000MGATWG&location=1264) ^ref-15191
