Leaders: Your training isn't a vitamin deficiency.  
  
â†’ It's active organizational hemorrhaging.  
  
Dear Leaders, Agile Coaches, and Product People:  
  
Quick question:  
  
Do you regularly run sessions where you need to transfer insights or grow team knowledge?  
  
If yes, here's the uncomfortable truth:  
  
Most of us treat training design as a vitamin (nice to have) when it's actually a painkiller (urgently needed).  
  
Let me show you why:  
  
Every minute of ineffective training multiplies by the number of attendees:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ 10 minutes with 6 attendees = 1 full working hour wasted  
â†’ 1 hour with 6 attendees = nearly a full working day gone  
â†’ 1 day with 6 attendees = more than a working week vanished  
  
That's not a vitamin deficiency. That's active organizational pain.  
  
I used to think my sessions were "good enough":  
â†’ I ran dozens monthly  
â†’ Attendees seemed engaged  
â†’ Feedback forms looked positive  
  
But the real costs were hidden:  
  
â†’ Concepts had to be repeatedly retaught  
â†’ Decisions weren't implemented  
â†’ Initial enthusiasm quickly evaporated  
â†’ Organizational change stalled  
  
We blame everything except our training design:  
â†’ "No time to implement"  
â†’ "Too many competing priorities"  
â†’ "The team isn't committed enough"  
  
Radical candor time:  
â†’ What you think is "good enough" training is actively costing you  
â†’ The pain is real, but you've normalized it  
â†’ Your organization is suffering from poor knowledge transfer daily  
  
4MAT showed me this painful reality. It revealed how much time and potential I was wasting with "good enough" training.  
  
Ready to treat the actual pain instead of ignoring it?  
  
DM or comment "red" for details on a potential next step.  
  
You rock, my friend! Whatever your next step is.
