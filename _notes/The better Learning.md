# [[The better Learning]]
## LinkedIn Post
[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_on-this-day-2-years-ago-i-quit-depending-activity-7214513537203736576-evm9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

  On this day 2 years ago, I quit depending on my brain alone and started growing my second brain so my learnings are no longer wasteful 🌱  
  
→ I felt overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information to remember  
→ I felt frustrated when I didn’t remember what I learned before  
→ It was tough to gain deeper insights on topics  
→ I spent time relearning the same things  
→ I struggled to provide timely solutions  
  
It became clear that I needed a better system!  
  
By coincidence, [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAfsKgMBS90pChyLlJHAyUjHIzLMKKVWEns)[David Moeller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-moeller-00362038/) showed me [Obsidian](https://www.linkedin.com/company/obsidianmd/).  
Obsidian’s ability to link notes and visualize connections impressed me.  
GOT HOOKED!  
  
That’s when I discovered the concept of a “Second Brain” — a personal knowledge management system that:  
  
→ Captures  
→ Organizes  
→ Distills information with precision  
  
Today, I:  
  
→ Record valuable insights immediately > optimized, frictionless  
→ Structure my thoughts; action-based > fast to keep, high actionability  
→ Distill key points > tailored for fast retention  
→ Create content, solve problems, and make decisions > faster and better  
  
This system transformed my approach to learning and productivity!  
  
Working with your Second Brain 🧠 results in:  
Increased creativity > No silos, connected thoughts, serendipity enabled  
→ Enhanced productivity >Less time searching and re-learning  
  
More time APPLYING. ACTION!  
  
You can experience that too!

## Content preparation

On this day 2 years ago,  I quit relying solely on my brain and started growing my second brain so my learnings are no longer wasteful 🌱

+ I felt overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information to remember and apply
+ I was frustrated that I did not remember what I learned before
+ I spent time again and again with learning the same things
+ It was tough to get deeper learnings on topics
+ I was not able to provide solutions timely

It became clear that I needed a better system!

By coincidence David Moeller showed my Obsidian. And I was impressed by the tools capability to link notes and visualise that. HOOKED!

That’s when I discovered the concept of a “second brain”. 
A personal knowledge management system that 
+ captures
+ organizes and 
+ distills information effectively

Today I:
+ Record valuable insights immediately > in an optimised, frictionless way
+ Structure my thoughts with an action based system > fast to retain, matching high actionability
+ Distill Key Points to focus on the most important takeaways > Tailored to me, for fast retention
+ Create content, solve problems, and make informed decisions > much faster and more informed than ever

* better retention > less wasteful repetitions,* enhanced productivity >less time search, re-learning but more time applying. ACTION!

You can experience that too! DM me SMART if you want to get a fast lane to start.
