At 8, I broke my favorite Christmas gift.  
  
â†’ Instead of punishment, my parents did something remarkable  
  
One Christmas gift stands out in my memory: a magnificent fire truck with blinking lights and intricate mechanics â€“ a treasure trove of discovery for an 8-year-old's curious mind.  
  
But curiosity has its price. Within two hours, driven by an irresistible urge to understand its inner workings, I had dismantled the truck completely.  
  
Unfortunately, my reassembly skills weren't quite as developed as my determination to explore.  
  
The toy was broken, but something more valuable was built: understanding.  
  
This "failure" taught me three invaluable lessons:  
  
â†’ When taking things apart, map your path back  
â†’ Breaking things is one gateway to understanding their mechanics  
â†’ True learning often comes from hands-on exploration  
(even when it leads to mistakes)  
  
I'm grateful that my parents chose to nurture my curiosity rather than constrain it. They understood that freedom to explore â€“ and face consequences â€“ builds deeper understanding.  
  
Deeper than any pristine, unexamined toy ever could.  
  
Do I still break things today?  
Oh yes, sometimes, big times ... more stories to follow...  
  
What did you break in your journey of discovery?

P.S.  
I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease
