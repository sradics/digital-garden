I bet on SELF DIRECTED education

â†’ I spent 4 years studying and used not much

I followed a recommendation and watched:
"Education that Works" by Danny Iny

While watching I nodded with YES a lot!

Education has not changed enough
Looking at the speed of changes
Education is mainly outdated

We still follow the myth to spent TIME
Our most valuable asset
4-7 years and more
Spending huge $
100-300k++ 
WASTED?!

Someone needs to strongly call it out:
âž  THE EMPEROR IS NAKED
âž  Something is messed up

I suggest to opt in to something better
SELF DIRECTED EDUCATION

Invest in learning how to:

â†’ Take Initiative
â†’ Be Resourceful
â†’ Get Things Done
â†’ Play well with others
â†’ Ask better questions
â†’ Handle Ambiguity well

â†’ Learn how Learn AND LEARN

Think like an EXPLORER, 
being excited about what you might find.

Knowledge is more accessible than ever before.
You can network with strong thinkers worldwide.
You can collect money through many ways.
You can use high speed, high impact learning.
You can learn self directed!

Your choice between

4-7 years time bound
Handholding
Conformity
Debt

â€”â€”â€” OR â€”â€”â€”

Your pace
Self directed
Passion + Iteration âž  Success

I'm now reading ðŸ“– Leveraged Learning

What is ONE thought that immediately comes to mind?
