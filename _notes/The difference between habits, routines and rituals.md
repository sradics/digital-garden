## Highlights
* ‚Äúhabit‚Äù and ‚Äúroutine‚Äù interchangeably, they both mean two distinct things.
* **main difference** between habits and routines is **how much aware and intentional you are**.
* A ==**habit usually manifests itself as an automatic urge to do something**==, often triggered by a particular cue.
* The stronger the connection between the trigger and the habit, the more ingrained the habit.
* **==routines require deliberate practice==**.
* going for a hike every Sunday, meditating are all routines that require to keep on consciously practicing them or they eventually die out.
* conscious thought, whereas **routines require a higher degree of intention and effort**.
* routines can turn into habits, but it is not an automatic, unconscious process.
* original **The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg**.
* Reward: do something enjoyable, which will tell your brain that this particular habit loop is worth remembering for the future.
* make it slightly easier to go from cue to routine and build a lasting habit loop.
* habit stacking:
* baby steps by anchoring a new tiny habit to an existing one.
* From routine to ritual
* The **difference between a routine and a ritual is the attitude behind the action.**
* shower‚Äî**==rituals are viewed as more meaningful practices which have a real sense of purpose.==**
* With **rituals, you are fully engaged with a focus on the experience of the task,** rather than its mere completion.
* **Applying mindfulness** to daily routines is a great way to create rituals for yourself.
* One of my favourite rituals is journaling. It‚Äôs one of the cornerstones of my mental gym.
