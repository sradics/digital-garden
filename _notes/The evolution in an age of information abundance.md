WARNING: This note-making technique may cause sudden bursts of insight  
  
â†’ My first touchpoint with S-R-R  
  
It is inspiring to observe our inner world evolving.  
  
Yesterday I wrote about the pressure to evolve - [https://lnkd.in/ewUZw6q2](https://lnkd.in/ewUZw6q2).  
  
Today I discovered an interesting path to explore.  
It is about working with our LinkedIn waves.  
Waves we create from our writing.  
  
Let's briefly look at different wave builders that appeared to me this week.  
  
Input One:  
â€”â€”â€”  
The course NOTEMAKING MASTERY by Nick Milo.  
It is only week one, and the course is already leading to a new level of working with my notes.  
  
I start to think deeper, more connected.  
  
  
Input Two:  
â€”â€”â€”  
The ðŸ“– recommendation - "Philosophy Quest for Truth". The book arrived yesterday and it will help me to deepen my understanding of Philosophy  
  
  
Input Three:  
â€”â€”â€”  
A podcast with Rolf Dobelli that showed me the connection between Stoicism and becoming Learning Champions.  
  
Let's get back to the wave.  
  
This morning I practiced what I learned about the sequence of note-making.  
  
I learned about SPARK - REMARK - RELATE  
â†’ catch a thought (S)  
â†’ create a note and write about that thought (R)  
â†’ relate that thought to other thoughts and existing notes (R)  
  
And I applied SRR to the comments of the post from yesterday.  
  
I took a note with my reflections on the comments. And discovered:  
â†’ Information abundance is a topic for many others too.  
â†’ People experience "learning as a chore"  
â†’ Exploring and being on a journey is a helpful mindset shift  
  
And on a meta-level, I discovered:  
â†’ I can help with structure  
â†’ We need to evolve our approaches to information abundance  
â†’ Stoicism and being a Learning Champion are linked.  
  
Three streams, leading to one bigger discovery:  
To nurture the great comments you all provide.  
  
To ride this wave, build by writing through it.  
  
Note-Making power is unfolding.  
  
What is your one note you can make today?

P.S.  
I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease
