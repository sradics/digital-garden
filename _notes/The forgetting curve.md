The monument that exposed my 10-year education failure  
  
â†’ How you can avoid 1200 hours of wasted learning  
  
Last week, on a walk with my children, they asked me for the meaning of a writing on a historical monument.  
  
I was blank. Unable to even read it.  
It was written in a foreign language.  
  
Here's the shocking part:  
  
â‡¢ I learned THAT language for 10 years.  
  
I was in a special school, aiming for higher learning, where learning this language was a main focus.  
  
The irony?  
  
â‡¢ I loved the school.  
â‡¢ I loved my classmates.  
âž  I just didn't love learning that language.  
  
Fast forward 30 years later - I can't even read the letters anymore.  
  
Think about this: 1200 hours of learning, completely lost.  
  
This is a testament to two truths:  
â†’ Learning without meaning leads nowhere  
â†’ "Forced" learning might make you pass an exam, but likely won't stick  
  
So how can we prevent this waste of time and energy?  
  
Here are three key strategies:  
â€”â€”â€”  
1) Add meaning to your learning.  
Connect it with real projects and apply your knowledge immediately.  
  
2) Make it stick with a proper learning approach.  
(Use proven methods that work with your brain, not against it)  
  
3)Â Time it right  
Don't force it - wait for the moment when need and energy align.  
Curiosity is your best teacher. Follow your inner signals for what to learn next.  

And if you're stuck in a "forced" learning system like school?  
  
â†’ Develop a "survival" strategy using strong learning techniques to navigate these challenging environments more effectively.
