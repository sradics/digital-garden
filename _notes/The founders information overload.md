How a 48-year-old founder beat information overload  
  
â†’ A founder's unexpected journey  
  
Meet Sebastian, a 48-year-old first-time founder  
with 26 years of professional experience.  
  
His recent learning investments:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ eMail-Marketing course  
â†’ LinkedIn growth cohort  
â†’ Entrepreneur community  
â†’ Business foundation program  
  
A total of more than $7000.  
  
Full steam ahead on professional development. But...  
Sebastian soon realized:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ What he learned seemed to fade fast  
â†’ He struggled to apply what he'd learned  
â†’ His investment risked becoming a write-off  
â†’ His insights were scattered, connections missing  
  
Sound familiar?  
  
Now imagine Sebastian three months later:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ He recalls key insights instantly  
â†’ He applies learnings confidently  
â†’ His compound expertise attracts investors  
â†’ His ideas connect across business domains  
  
The difference?  
âž  Sebastian is using a knowledge flywheel.  
  
His new system:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Fits his busy founder life  
â†’ Connects scattered insights  
â†’ Transforms learning into action
