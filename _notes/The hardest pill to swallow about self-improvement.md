## Highlights
* we may have not gotten the encouragement for self-betterment, we have no one around us who are striving for the best — so we want to consume and process all the information, methods, tips, and tricks we can.
* ==The real truth about self-development, the real pain is the application.==
* ==How many people are out there actively trying, failing, getting knocked down on their ass, and trying again? Very few.==
* There are some that are more “optimal” than others, but they will all work — if applied.
* We need to ==build a core set of practices and not stray from the narrow road of improvement.==
* ==You can’t know all the answers before you take action. You need to act before you are ready.==
