## Highlights
* ==Credit card hacking== is a ==prime example of doing $10/hour work==. * It feels productive (free money!). * It releases dopamine (A free flight upgrade!) * And it makes you feel like you’re outfoxing a competitor (I got away with THIS!).
	==* But does not move the needle==
* ==$10k/hour examples. What would move the needle? * Cancelling Amazon prime. * Conducting a monthly money review with your spouse. * Paying cash for all purchases. * Learning how to cook.== * Automating a 529 plan for an unborn child.
* But because the deliberate investment you make will pay off in spades at a future date.
* ==identifying your highest leverage activities==
* ==$10/hour work The land of low skill low leverage work is plastered with all kinds of temptations.==
* ==$10/hour work is busywork. Full stop. It doesn’t move the needle.==
* A litmus test for ==$10/hour work is: could I do this hungover?==
* ==$100/hour work This quadrant is busywork at scale.==
	* Said differently, you’re ==leveraging the wrong skill.==
* But his ==$10,000/hour skill was knowing just enough about each function and distilling complex issues into simple questions.==
* There’s no swoosh sound when you complete it. ==Zero dopamine. The results aren’t seen for years, if not decades.==
* What's more, ==$10K work is personal. It's a peculiar cocktail of your industry, skills, passions, curiosities, relationships and vision.==
* some high-leverage and high-skill activities?
