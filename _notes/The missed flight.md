Today morning I missed that important flight 

âž  full trust that things will work out

Today I'm giving a workshop at the Tech Leadership Summit

Topic: Smart Learning and Leadership 
âž  Empowering Yourself and Your Team in the AI Era

The workshop is at 13:30 in Zurich. 
And I'm still sitting in Berlin. 

â†’ got up 3:35AM
â†’ went to the Airport 
â†’ had to turn as I missed my passport
â†’ blocked roads, traffic jam (at 4:45 AM??!)
â†’ arrived okish in the parking lot
â†’ TRANSFER to Airport-- took me 30'
â†’ MISSED the flight by 2'

Panic mode for a short moment. 
Then I converted to focus mode.

Luck was with me. 
I was able to book another flight.
This morning 9:35AM. 
(don't ask for the penalty I had to pay)

As I'm writing I'm waiting for the flight.
So keep fingers crossed!! 
I trust the universe. All will work out.

Learning hat on:
â†’ I need even more buffer time
â†’ And check the transfer times from parking lots too
â†’ Stay calm, breathe, start to think clearly

When was the last time you got in a "little" hurry?
