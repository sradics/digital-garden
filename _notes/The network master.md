The 18th century's LinkedIn:  
  
â†’ One man's 550-strong network  
  
I'm just writing from Halberstadt.  
A city also known for Johann Wilhelm Ludwig Gleim (1719-1803).  
He was a prominent figure in the German Enlightenment.  
  
Gleim was renowned for fostering relationships with  
influentialÂ thinkers of his time, including  
Lessing, Klopstock, and Herder.  
  
He maintained correspondence with over 550 individuals.  
  
He utilized letters as a means of connection  
(when communication was primarily through postal services)  
  
Hi built a literary community  
that transcended social boundaries,  
promoting an atmosphere of  
intellectual exchange and camaraderie  
  
Today I'm thankful for being able to build  
strong relationships across the world and  
exchange with high quality and instant speed.  
  
I can feel and experience the atmosphere of  
intellectual exchange and camaraderie.  
  
Thank YOU for reading, commenting, challenging.  
  
It means a lot to me.
