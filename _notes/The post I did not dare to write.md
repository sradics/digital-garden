The hidden economic shift AI is creating  
  
â†’ Am I Fred from "Our Iceberg is Melting"  
  
I was hesitant to express my challenging opinion about AI's role in the world.  
  
But I got my wake-up call about 1.5 years ago.  
  
I watched an enlightening episode of the Emergency Podcast (link in the comments) featuring Mo Gawdat and Steven Bartlett. Since then, one question has kept me on a constant search:  
  
When AI becomes more intelligent and surpasses human capabilities in nearly every domain, what implications does that have for our current system of working for money and using money to sustain our lives?  
  
  
Working for money may no longer be valid.  
  
  
I might be a bit ahead of the curve here, and perhaps that level of AI intelligence is still 5â€“15 years away. However, given the rapid pace of development and the already astonishing capabilities weâ€™re seeing, I canâ€™t help but wonder.  
  
I wonder, why this topic is so invisible.  
  
Or am I just looking in the wrong places?  
Could I be wrong in my assumptions?  
  
One school of thought suggests that economic changes will create many new jobs to support these emerging capabilities, as has been true during past shifts.  
  
  
However, this time, thereâ€™s a significant differenceâ€”one often overlooked in discussions.  
  
For the first time, we are on the brink of creating something far smarter than ourselves. With such systems, the need for human labor to perform tasks diminishes significantly.  
  
The first step will be upskillingâ€”learning entirely new capabilitiesâ€”because routine, easy-to-do jobs will be automated at lightning speed.  
  
Weâ€™re already beginning to see these changes in the job market. Itâ€™s worth noting, however, that larger companies, in particular, tend to adopt new approaches slowly. As a result, AIâ€™s impact hasnâ€™t yet fully revealed the deeper shifts it will bring. This wave is building, and weâ€™ll witness its full force soon.  
  
With upskilling, itâ€™s possible to navigate the first wave of change, and Iâ€™m happy to assist with quick and effective ways to learn and master new fields.  
  
However, I donâ€™t yet have an answer for how to address the higher-capability roles that will soon also be at risk.  
  
I'm curious - what is your take on this development?  
  
Am I being too pessimistic?  
  
Am I Fred from "Our Iceberg is Melting"?  
  
I don't know. What about you?
