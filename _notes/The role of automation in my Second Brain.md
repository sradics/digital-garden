How I reduce cognitive load through automating my Second Brain

In my Second Brain I maintain several workflows. To simplify and reduce cognitive load automation and shortcuts are key to me.

8 automations that help me in my daily Second Brain work:
+ I learned and repeated the main shortcuts on Obsidian. 
+ I invested in a Loupedeck controller and added several Obsidian specific shortcuts to simplify creating notes
+ I use templates for my different note types (Fleeting Notes, Literature Notes, Permanent Note, Index Note)
+ Combined template for automated moving of notes to the right folder
+ automated import of all Matter highlights and all Kindle highlights
+ semi automated import of images, documents, voice memos
+ semi-automated export to my digital garden
+ leverage data views to aggregate notes overviews. E.g. all my LinkedIn articles or all my Kindle books

I observe where I use repeated activities and invest in continuously improve my approach with automations. This way I can focus on important, higher level topics and leverage technology to help me getting rid of mundane tasks.
