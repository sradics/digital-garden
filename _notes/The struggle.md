Something's not adding up here.  
  
→ And it's keeping me up at night.  
  
Cohort #01 of Learning Ecosystem Mastery:  
→ 21 participants, 15 paid  
→ Outstanding feedback and results  
→ Wall of Love testimonials [https://lnkd.in/eCHtsFDq](https://lnkd.in/eCHtsFDq)  
  
Cohort #02 launching Wednesday July 23:  
→ Same proven system  
→ Same immersive experience  
→ Just 2 signups  
  
Honestly? It stings a bit. Not just the numbers, but the disconnect between what I know works and what I'm apparently communicating.  
  
But something in the connection isn't clicking.  
And here's the thing that's eating at me:  
  
I've spent months refining this system. Seen people's lives genuinely transform. Built something I wish I'd had when I was drowning in information chaos.  
  
Yet I'm sitting here wondering if I'm the problem.  
  
→ Is it timing? (Summer gap in Europe/US)  
→ Is it messaging? (Too detailed vs too simple)  
→ Is it positioning? (Course vs transformation)  
→ Or is it me? (Am I in my own bubble?)  
  
Even after writing about it from various perspectives. With posts, with newsletters, with workshops. Even after showing real results.  
  
The system works. The communication pipeline doesn't.  
  
Here's what I'm working with: [https://lnkd.in/eWFzsQaN](https://lnkd.in/eWFzsQaN)  
  
I know it's detailed, but I expect people like you to check for details when making a decision. At least I do so.  
  
The irony kills me:  
  
I've invested more in learning courses this past year than what I'm charging for 9 weeks of transformation. I built exactly what I desperately needed 2 years ago when I was overwhelmed by information chaos.  
  
But apparently, knowing what works and communicating what works are two completely different skills.  
  
And right now, I'm clearly missing something fundamental about the second one.  
  
Maybe I'm too close to see it clearly.  
Maybe I'm solving a problem people don't think they have.  
Maybe I'm just not the right messenger for this message.  
  
But I can't shake the feeling that there's something obvious I'm missing.  
  
What patterns do you see here?  
  
When you've built something that works but struggle to communicate its value, what's usually the missing piece?  
  
I'm genuinely stuck on this puzzle, and I'd value your outside perspective more than you might realize.  
  
Drop your thoughts below or as DM.
