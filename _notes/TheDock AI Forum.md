I'm sitting by the window at The Barn, watching Berlin wake up outside.  
My oat milk latte sits steaming in front of meâ€”strong coffee, exactly what I need. It's 9:00, and TheDock starts in thirty minutes.  
  
I keep glancing between my phone and the street, tapping my fingers lightly on the table. There's this mix of butterflies and calm running through me.  
  
I'm thinking, "I wonder what other power users will be here. After living with [Langdock](https://www.linkedin.com/company/langdock/) daily, I'm curious what insights everyone else has discovered."  
I catch myself smiling at the thought.  
  
A man at the next table is in deep thinking mode, scribbling morning notes in his journal. It reminds me of yesterday's sessionâ€”watching participants build their first AI assistant, that moment when everything clicked. I lean back in my chair, taking a slow sip of coffee, and think, "Lots to share today."
