My 9-year-old chef's near-fatal mistake  
  
â†’ One unasked question almost cost everything  
  
Fire and Curiosity - Part 3: The Prevented explosion  
  
If my previous encounters with fire taught me valuable lessons,  
this one could have been my last learning experience altogether.  
  
At age 9, I proudly joined the ranks of "self-sufficient" cooks.  
My signature dish was simple: bread, eggs, and vegetables in a pan â€“ prepared almost daily after school on our gas stove.  
  
A wonderful appliance... when you know how to use it properly.  
  
I felt like a master chef as I lit the stove, carefully cracked the eggs, and managed the whole process.  
  
After about 10, my culinary creation was complete.  
I took the pan off the heat, I "turned off" the stove. But that small flame still flickered. My 9-year-old logic was simple: flame = candle. So naturally, I blew it out.  
  
The meal was delicious, and I headed off to soccer practice with pride. Yet something felt off.  
  
That nagging feeling about the "candle" wouldn't leave me.  
  
Later, I understood why.  
  
I returned home to find a house still standing â€“ thanks to pure luck. My father had arrived before me and immediately detected the gas filling our home. If he had lit a cigarette...  
  
Sometimes the most important lessons come from disasters that almost happened:  
  
â†’ Trust your gut when something feels wrong  
â†’ Safety features exist for good reasons  
â†’ When in doubt, ask for help  

What childhood close call taught you the value of luck?  
  
(And thus concludes my fire trilogy, where danger levels escalated from  
â†’ breaking toys (1/5) - [https://lnkd.in/ergfhZD2](https://lnkd.in/ergfhZD2)  
â†’ burning lamps (3/5) - [https://lnkd.in/eDhbb8yr](https://lnkd.in/eDhbb8yr)  
â†’ nearly blowing up our house (5/5).  
  
Sometimes the best teachers are our mistakes)

P.S.  
I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease
