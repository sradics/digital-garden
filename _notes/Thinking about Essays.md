[[The Ultimate Guide to Writing Online – Write of Passage]]

==Write **Personal**, **Observational** and **Playful**==
+ **==If your words make you feel naked, you’re probably onto something.==** 
+ **Jokes, riddles, slang, ==coined terms==, funny phrases, and ==thought experiments== are all part of the repertoire.** Sneak your sentences some swigs of tequila until they’re a little tipsy (too much will make your reader gag). **==If you’re making your ~prisoner~ reader smile, you’re onto something==**.

**[[The Ultimate Guide to Writing Online – Write of Passage#TYPES OF FEEDBACK|CRIBS - Confusing, Repeated, Interesting, Boring, Surprising]]**

 **==Good writers distill hours (or weeks) of experience into a short, compressed artifact.==** 


 **==No matter how good it was, it wouldn’t spread without great marketing.==** 

**==Think of newsletters like little “Digital Postcards.” They can be quick and personal.==**


**==A shiny dime is the smallest viable idea you can write about.==** Like “Snakes on a Plane,” it’s **==the most compressed distillation of what you’re trying to say==**
+ **==Good writing is focused. It orbits around a single point.==**
+ **==A coined phrase is the most compressed version of a shiny dime.==**

**Coined phrases often hold these characteristics:**

1.  **==Surprising==** – They surprise us in the moment, but feel obvious in retrospect. Once we see them, we can’t unsee them. 
2.  **==Ambiguous==** – They create suspense and spark the reader’s curiosity. 
3.  ==**Visual**== – Good metaphors activate the reader’s senses and are as vivid as they are true. 
4.  ==**Fun**== – Like a jingle, you can’t help but say them out-loud. 

**==Keep your grammar simple at first. Extravagant punctuation can distract from your main message. If you break the rules, do it deliberately (like Monet).==**
