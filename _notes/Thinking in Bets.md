Hindsight bias is the tendency, after an outcome is known, to see the outcome as having been inevitable. — location: [203](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=203) ^ref-13812

---
When we say, “I should have known that would happen,” or, “I should have seen it coming,” we are succumbing to hindsight bias. — location: [204](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=204) ^ref-26321

Incorrectly interpreting rustling from the wind as an oncoming lion is called a type I error, a false positive.

We can measure the lines to confirm they are the same length, but we can’t make ourselves unsee the illusion. — location: [272](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=272) ^ref-13449

Our goal is to get our reflexive minds to execute on our deliberative minds’ best intentions. — location: [278](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=278) ^ref-53869

Real life consists of bluffing, of little tactics of deception, of asking yourself what is the other man going to think I mean to do. And that is what games are about in my theory.’” — location: [339](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=339) ^ref-62183

Poker, in contrast, is a game of incomplete information. It is a game of decision-making under conditions of uncertainty over time. (Not coincidentally, that is close to the definition of — location: [353](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=353) ^ref-38533

A great decision is the result of a good process, and that process must include an attempt to accurately represent our own state of knowledge. That state of knowledge, in turn, is some variation of “I’m not sure.” — location: [435](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=435) ^ref-18411

When we think in advance about the chances of alternative outcomes and make a decision based on those chances, it doesn’t automatically make us wrong when things don’t work out. — location: [490](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=490) ^ref-53654

part of the skill in life comes from learning to be a better belief calibrator, using experience and information to more objectively update our beliefs to more accurately represent the world. — location: [724](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=724) ^ref-47630

People are credulous creatures who find it very easy to believe and very difficult to doubt. In fact, believing is so easy, and perhaps so inevitable, — location: [753](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=753) ^ref-53477

---
In this case, the system we already had was (1) experience it, (2) believe it to be true, and (3) maybe, and rarely, question it later. — location: [777](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=777) ^ref-41151

We form beliefs without vetting most of them, — location: [812](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=812) ^ref-35553

Truthseeking, the desire to know the truth regardless of whether the truth aligns with the beliefs we currently hold, is not naturally supported by the way we process information. — location: [818](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=818) ^ref-45642

---
We might think of ourselves as open-minded and capable of updating our beliefs based on new information, but the research conclusively shows otherwise. Instead of altering our beliefs to fit new information, we do the opposite, altering our interpretation of that information to fit our beliefs. — location: [819](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=819) ^ref-60658

Our beliefs affect how we process all new things, “whether the ‘thing’ is a football game, a presidential candidate, Communism, or spinach.” — location: [850](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=850) ^ref-16792

Fake news works because people who already hold beliefs consistent with the story generally won’t question the evidence. — location: [882](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=882) ^ref-55327

---
we just want to think well of ourselves and feel that the narrative of our life story is a positive one. — location: [895](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=895) ^ref-58669

---
we have only two options: (a) make the massive shift in our opinion of ourselves from 100% right to 100% wrong, or (b) ignore or discredit the new information. It feels bad to be wrong, so we choose (b). — location: [897](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=897) ^ref-54584

Information that disagrees with us is an assault on our self-narrative. — location: [899](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=899) ^ref-24504

On the flip side, when additional information agrees with us, we effortlessly embrace it. — location: [900](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=900) ^ref-4330

yes, we all have a blind spot about recognizing our biases. — location: [913](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=913) ^ref-45680

It turns out the better you are with numbers, the better you are at spinning those numbers to conform to and support your beliefs. — location: [932](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=932) ^ref-38488

---
Just as we can’t unsee an illusion, intellect or willpower alone can’t make us resist motivated reasoning. — location: [936](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=936) ^ref-21478

---
We bet on our beliefs. We don’t vet those beliefs well before we form them. — location: [937](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=937) ^ref-44441

When someone challenges us to bet on a belief, signaling their confidence that our belief is inaccurate in some way, — location: [945](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=945) ^ref-57718

---
ideally it triggers us to vet the belief, — location: [945](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=945) ^ref-51973

---
How do I know this? Where did I get this information? Who did I get it from? What is the quality of my sources? How much do I trust them? How up to date is my information? How much information do I have that is relevant to the belief? What other things like this have I been confident about that turned out not to be true? What are the other plausible alternatives? What do I know about the person challenging my belief? What is their view of how credible my opinion is? What do they know that I don’t know? What is their level of expertise? What am I missing? — location: [947](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=947) ^ref-31810

“Wanna bet?” triggers us to engage in that third step that we only sometimes get to. — location: [961](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=961) ^ref-50427

We can train ourselves to view the world through the lens of “Wanna bet?” — location: [976](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=976) ^ref-24878

When confronted with new evidence, it is a very different narrative to say, “I was 58% but now I’m 46%.” — location: [1018](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=1018) ^ref-42769

The result is that we don’t learn from experience well. — location: [1240](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=1240) ^ref-55550

The key is that in explicitly recognizing that the way we field an outcome is a bet, we consider a greater number of alternative causes more seriously than we otherwise would have. That is truthseeking. — location: [1536](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=1536) ^ref-58311
