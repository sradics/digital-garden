## Highlights
when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution. — location: [258](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=258) ^ref-53948

One of the significant discoveries of cognitive psychologists in recent decades is that switching from one task to another is effortful, especially under time pressure. — location: [610](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=610) ^ref-47213

They are more alert, more intellectually active, less willing to be satisfied with superficially attractive answers, more skeptical about their intuitions.

They found that putting the participants in a good mood before the test by having them think happy thoughts more than doubled accuracy.

System 1, which understands language, has access to norms of categories, which specify the range of plausible values as well as the most typical cases. — location: [1282](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=1282) ^ref-19547

In Bloom’s view, the two concepts of causality were shaped separately by evolutionary forces, building the origins of religion into the structure of System 1. — location: [1334](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=1334) ^ref-16568

System 1 does not keep track of alternatives that it rejects, or even of the fact that there were alternatives. — location: [1375](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=1375) ^ref-26532

information it does not have. The measure of success for System 1 is the coherence of the story it manages to create. The amount and quality of the data on which the story is based are largely irrelevant. — location: [1473](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=1473) ^ref-26967

WYSIATI, which stands for what you see is all there is. System 1 is radically insensitive to both the quality and the quantity of the information that gives rise to impressions and intuitions. — location: [1487](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=1487) ^ref-53858

In general, a strategy of deliberately “thinking the opposite” may be a good defense against anchoring effects, because it negates the biased recruitment of thoughts that produces these effects. — location: [2147](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=2147) ^ref-51317

As malpractice litigation became more common, physicians changed their procedures in multiple ways: ordered more tests, referred more cases to specialists, applied conventional treatments even when they were unlikely to help.
