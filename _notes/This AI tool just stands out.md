# [[This AI tool just stands out]]
## LinkedIn Post
[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_i-got-lost-with-100-ai-prompts-3-llms-activity-7231902874341904385--tEV?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

I got lost with 100+ AI prompts, 3+ LLMs 🤯  
  
→ Now I save TIME, MONEY and SIMPLIFIED AI  
→ LLMs, Prompts, Assistants all in ONE  
→ with [Langdock](https://www.linkedin.com/company/langdock/) as my #1 AI tool  
  
———  
3 Reasons why Langdock stands out for me  
———  
  
1‍⃣ Integration with DATA SOURCES  
(lGoogle Drive, Vector Databases or Upload)  
  
➠ I can easily use my existing knowledge with AI  
  
As an example I wrote down 15 episodes of my life.  
Now I can use AI to help me to write in a story format.  
  
→ Add templates for Story Telling  
→ Just upload my Stories as Knowledge  
→ Ask your LLM of Choice to do its magic  
  
➠ DRAFT - Polish - Publish -- much easier  
  
2‍⃣ Fast usage of DIFFERENT LLMs  
(ChatGPT, Claude, LLama,...)  
  
➠ All in one place  
➠ Unbeatable cost structure  
  
I can easily experiment with Prompts and get different outputs.  

3‍⃣ ASSISTANTS that combine prompts and knowledge  
(like GPTs but better)  
  
→ with different DataSources (see 1)  
→ usable with different LLMs (see 2)  
  
  
PLUS  
→ You can manage PROMPT LIBRARIES  

The RESULTS:  
  
➠ A cost efficient approach with different LLMs  
➠ Better integration with my knowledge  
➠ Simpler Management of AI  
  
  
Have fun experimenting with Langdock!  
Let me know if I can help.
