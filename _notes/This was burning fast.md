At 10, I became an accidental arsonist  
  
â†’ in between the flames and the truth  
  
Fire and Curiosity - Part 2: The Paper Light  
  
Remember my broken fire truck and how destroying my favorite Christmas gift led to an even greater gift? Well, that wasn't my last encounter with fiery curiosity.  
  
(In case missed it - here is Part 1 - the broken fire truck: [https://lnkd.in/ergfhZD2](https://lnkd.in/ergfhZD2) )  
  
At age 10, our living room featured a beautiful paper balloon lamp that cast the most enchanting light. But what caught my attention wasn't its glow â€“ it was a tiny burn hole in the paper shade.  
  
You can probably guess what happened next.  
  
One matchstick and one "experimental moment" later,  
the entire lamp erupted in flames.  
  
Pure panic seized me as I frantically patted out the fire with my bare hands. Luck was on my side â€“ the fire was quickly extinguished.  
  
But now came an even bigger challenge: facing my parents.  
  
In my distress, I sought wisdom from my great-grandparents. They taught me one important lesson:  
  
âž  Hiding from mistakes only compounds them  
âž  The only way forward is through honesty and accountability  
  
So when my parents returned home, they found their trembling 10-year-old son, with cold sweaty hands and tears in his eyes, ready to confess.  
  
No sugar-coating â€“ just the plain truth about my "scientific experiment" gone wrong.  
  
The relief I felt when they responded with love rather than anger was overwhelming.  
  
It taught me that honesty, even in our failures,  
strengthens rather than breaks trust.  
  
Have you ever faced that moment when hiding seemed easier, but you chose the braver path of truth?  
  
(Stay tuned for the final chapter of my fire trilogy...)
