# [[This will change your facilitation and training design]]
## LinkedIn Post
[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_i-ran-100s-of-workshops-many-focused-on-activity-7294611073041649665-n76n?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAA1M1pkBgWCYPhT45EpfLiHzViQqRWNCIv4)

I ran 100s of workshops, many focused on teaching and training.  
  
But something was missing...  
â†’ My flow felt choppy  
â†’ Full engagement was rare  
â†’ Learning impact faded fast  
  
I kept thinking about all the potential left untapped.  
Either from workshops that fell short,  
or training sessions I never dared to design.  
  
Imagine instead:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Creating learning sessions where every participant is fully engaged  
â†’ Having a proven structure that makes training design fun and easy  
â†’ Delivering experiences where knowledge truly sticks  
  
I searched for years to bridge this gap.  
Until I found what changes everything for learning facilitators...  
  
4MAT training design unlocks your potential:  
â€”â€”â€”  
âž  Your learners engage fully, by design  
âž  Your teaching workshop design flows naturally  
âž  Your training impact lasts, while everyone enjoys the journey  
  
It all started when I joined [Hanne Houbak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanne-houbak-4aa5252/)'s 4MAT training  
(Europe's leading 4MAT expert!)  
  
Here's the exciting news - Hanne and I are bringing this to Hamburg soon!
