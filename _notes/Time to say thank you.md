The day I stopped hiding my stories and started sharing them  
  
â†’ Warning: This storytelling hack may make you TOO popular  
  
I always get hooked on great stories.  
And I'm impressed by the talent of writing and telling stories.  
  
I'm not good at that. I'd better write my facts and hope for the best.  
â†’ That is how I started my journey of writing on LinkedIn.  
â†’ That is what scared me about writing longer forms, like a newsletter.  
  
Negative self talk and talent attribution instead of applying a growth mindset.  
  
And I guess that was what she noticed.  
She noticed me NOT bringing my message across.  
  
I don't know what provided the final impulse. Maybe it was another failed attempt to write with clarity, to write with a flow, to write in a way that others might read it.  
  
But back in July, she reached out.  
She - my writing hero, she [Isabella Masucci](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabella-masucci-79418080/).  
  
Since then, Isabella has helped me with deeply extracting the stories I have to tell about Learning to Learn.  
  
I can tell you, these are quite some stories.  
Many were buried deep inside.  
  
But she knows how to make me talk:  
â†’ her interview style  
â†’ her way to actively listen  
â†’ to throw in the right question at the right moment  
  
It made me open up. To show my emotions. To tell my stories.  
  
With that the next level work starts.  
  
Isabella summarized and gave me access to the interviews too.  
Already a treasure on its own.  
  
Next, she wrote my stories. And what stories.  
I love her writing. It feels like holding a mirror to myself.  
She kept my authentic voice, and at the same time helped me to  
  
â†’ Bridge my English skill gaps  
â†’ Write in story format  
â†’ Bring order to chaos  
  
If you are interested, you will experience more and more of Isabella's influence shining through my newsletters.  
  
I'll expose deeper stories about Basti (me) and why it matters so much to me, that we learn how to learn.  
  
Curious?  
  
My next newsletter will be shipped tomorrow at 13:00 CET. So still time to subscribe.  
  
And I'll link edition 001 in the comments too.  
One deep first story - "The split on my upper lip"  

Please give a round of applause to [Isabella Masucci](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabella-masucci-79418080/)!  
  
And tell me - who is ONE story telling influencer for you?  

â€”â€”â€”  
P.S.  
I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease
