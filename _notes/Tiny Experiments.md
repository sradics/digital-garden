4,783 productivity books exist  
  
â†’ but only one teaches you to befriend procrastination.  
  
Yesterday Tiny Experiments by [Anne-Laure Le Cunff, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neuranne/) arrived on my Kindle.  
I started reading right away.  
Being half way through I can already express:  
  
Tiny Experiments is a must read to get into Mindful Productivity  
â†’ It's the antidote to toxic productivity culture  
â†’ Packed with relatable personal stories and actionable insights  
  
As a long-time follower of Anne-Laure's work and Ness Labs community member, I can't overstate the value packed into these pages.  

My top 4 inspirations (so far):  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Work with a PACT  
Welcome tiny progress steps and get into an experimental mindset  
  
â†’ Befriend procrastination: What's it really telling you?  
  
â†’ Head-Heart-Hand framework to understand procrastination holistically  
  
â†’ Grow KAIROS rituals  
Small actions to open a magic window to Mindful productivity  

Let's close with this inspiring question - a curiosity opener:  
  
What experiment could you run on your own life that would bring you an intrinsic sense of fulfillment, whatever the outcome?  

I'm super curios for part II of the book. You too?
