## Highlights
Thanks to the enormous success of Learning to See, value-stream mapping became one of the most widely used tools to teach and practice Toyota’s vaunted production system. — location: [65](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=65) ^ref-38719

---
with an understanding that outstanding financial results and long-term organization survival follow best from continuous and robust process improvement and adaptation—not from driving people to achieve financial targets without regard for how their actions affect processes. — location: [92](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=92) ^ref-44746

In many organizations there is an unspoken frustration because of a gap between desired results and what really happens. — location: [118](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=118) ^ref-1063

not the people, but rather the prevailing management system within which we work that is a culprit. — location: [132](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=132) ^ref-64208

The problem is not that a company’s thinking is old, but that its thinking does not incorporate constant improvement and adaptation. — location: [136](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=136) ^ref-22556

With that in mind, here is my definition of management: The systematic pursuit of desired conditions by utilizing human capabilities in a concerted way. — location: [141](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=141) ^ref-62120

that an effective management system will be one that keeps an organization adjusting to unpredictable, dynamic conditions and satisfying customers. — location: [145](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=145) ^ref-48856

Of greater interest is how people can sense and understand a situation, and react to it in a way that moves the organization forward. — location: [148](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=148) ^ref-18163

The evidence of the last 20 years indicates that trying to copy or reproduce another company’s tools, techniques, or principles does little to change an organization’s culture, its way of doing things. — location: [161](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=161) ^ref-49603

However, inferring that there has been a technological inflection point is a kind of “benchmarking trap,” which arises because benchmarking studies are done at a point in time. — location: [289](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=289) ^ref-21780

---
The way from where we are to where we want to be next is a gray zone full of unforeseeable obstacles, problems, and issues that we can only discover along the way. — location: [310](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=310) ^ref-24605

humans have a tendency to want certainty, and even to artificially create it, based on beliefs, when there is none. — location: [316](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=316) ^ref-6068

If someone claims certainty about the steps that will be implemented to reach a desired destination, that should be a red flag to — location: [320](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=320) ^ref-40804

How do we get through that territory? By what means can we go beyond what we can see? What is management’s role in this? — location: [324](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=324) ^ref-58128

---
The implication is that if we want our organization to thrive for a long time, then how it interacts with conditions inside and outside the company is important. — location: [336](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=336) ^ref-1763

The objective is not to win, but to develop the capability of the organization to keep improving, adapting, and satisfying dynamic customer requirements. — location: [338](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=338) ^ref-58954

Improvement, adaptation, and even innovation result to a great extent from the accumulation of small steps; — location: [341](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=341) ^ref-20545

each lesson learned helps us recognize the next step and adds to our knowledge and capability. — location: [342](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=342) ^ref-47059

Cost and quality improvements are actually made in small steps and take considerable time to achieve and accumulate. — location: [349](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=349) ^ref-57445

Let’s agree on a definition of continuous improvement: it means that you are improving all processes every day. — location: [363](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=363) ^ref-3902

---
A process will tend to erode no matter what, even if a standard is defined, explained to everyone, and posted. This is not because of poor discipline by workers (as many of us may believe), but due to interaction effects and entropy, which says than any organized process naturally tends to decline to a chaotic state if we leave it alone — location: [370](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=370) ^ref-39138

---
It is an issue of human behavior. — location: [393](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=393) ^ref-8936

---
Toyota’s ability to continuously improve and adapt lies in the actions and reactions of the people in the firm, in their ability to effectively understand situations and develop smart solutions. Toyota considers the improvement capability of all the people in an organization the “strength” of a company. — location: [395](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=395) ^ref-42293

---
From this perspective, then, it is better for an organization’s adaptiveness, competitiveness, and survival to have a large group of people systematically, methodically, making many small steps of improvement every day rather than a small group doing periodic big projects and events. — location: [397](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=397) ^ref-26603

---
At Toyota, improvement and adaptation are systematic and the method is a fundamental component of every task performed, not an add-on or a special initiative. — location: [411](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=411) ^ref-59000

A key concept underlying kata is that while we often cannot exercise much control over the realities around us, we can exercise control over—manage—how we deal with them. — location: [433](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=433) ^ref-10093

---
Principles are developed out of repeated action, and concerted repeated action is what a kata guides you into. — location: [441](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=441) ^ref-24988

---
Any organization whose members can face unpredictable and uncertain situations (which are the norm) with confidence and effective action, because they have learned a behavioral routine for doing that, can enjoy a competitive advantage. — location: [481](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=481) ^ref-36684

What is our current thinking? Where does it come from? How do we tend to act as a result? What are the effects? — location: [492](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=492) ^ref-56519

Since the workshop team moves on or is disbanded after a workshop ends, we have to expect that entropy will naturally begin eroding the gains that have been made. — location: [507](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=507) ^ref-49808

Value-stream mapping is not intended to be a method for process improvement, but rather a method to help ensure that process-level improvement efforts: — location: [516](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=516) ^ref-6549

Once you finish Part III of this book you will be able to see that the list approach is an unscientific and ineffective method for process improvement. — location: [557](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=557) ^ref-11717

---
In many cases the scattershot list approach creates even more, not less, variability and instability in a process. — location: [561](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=561) ^ref-55664

---
“What do we need to do to improve this process?” Admittedly, this is a more difficult question. — location: [571](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=571) ^ref-56344

---
It is much more difficult to see deeply and understand what we need to do. — location: [580](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=580) ^ref-57803

---
In contrast, Toyota’s goal in process improvement is to learn; to develop an ever deeper understanding of the work process and to improve the process from that basis. — location: [586](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=586) ^ref-56172

---
For everyone involved, the list approach provides a way to feel engaged in improvement activity without having to alter their current work routines very much. — location: [595](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=595) ^ref-24759

completed my action items on time,” and thereby fulfill our obligations without necessarily having to generate real process improvement. — location: [597](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=597) ^ref-56668

---
To see what I mean, consider that Toyota teaches people to try to change only one thing at a time, and then to check the result against the expected result. You may work on several things simultaneously, but if possible do not change more than one thing at any one time in a process. — location: [602](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=602) ^ref-6381

and understand cause and effect, which helps to develop a deeper understanding of the work processes. — location: [605](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=605) ^ref-32888

This means that once we have implemented one or two items from an action-item list, then the rest of the items on that predefined list may no longer suit the new situation and new priorities at the process. — location: [608](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=608) ^ref-21424

Multifactor experiments (known as Design of Experiments, or DOE) where multiple variables are changed at once are sometimes necessary, but only a small group of specialists is qualified to conduct them. — location: [610](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=610) ^ref-38194

---
We should check the results of a change as soon as possible and then, based on what we learn, consider the next steps. — location: [619](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=619) ^ref-62070

---
Notice the position of improvement and adaptation in each case. — location: [638](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=638) ^ref-12420

---
At Toyota, improving and managing are one and the same. — location: [650](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=650) ^ref-62182

---
We would feel we were letting go of something we currently try very hard to control, because we’re accustomed to focusing on outcomes, not process details. — location: [654](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=654) ^ref-20064

---
Toyota puts considerable emphasis on how people tackle the details of a process, which is what generates the outcomes. — location: [656](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=656) ^ref-38152

---
This meant that the plant was standing still—not continuously making progress or improving—and that is quite possibly what Toyota fears most of all. — location: [684](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=684) ^ref-20614

What is the true business philosophy of your company? — location: [687](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=687) ^ref-46906

The unspoken business philosophy at some companies is simply to produce and sell more. — location: [689](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=689) ^ref-3722

Or it is about exercising rank and privilege, and thus avoiding mistakes, hiding problems, and getting promoted, which become more important than performance, achievement, and continuous improvement. — location: [690](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=690) ^ref-16496

---
we cannot discern what is important to improve, and we tend to maximize the efficiency of one area at the expense of another, shifting wastes from one to another rather than optimizing and synchronizing the whole. — location: [695](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=695) ^ref-6922

---
those containers near the operator’s fingertips. And since the quantity of delivered parts will now be smaller—because fewer parts can be stored so close to the operator—my people will have to deliver several times a shift, rather than only once or twice per shift. Now we all know that ‘lean’ means eliminating waste. All those extra non-value-added activities would obviously be waste, so this cannot be the right solution.” — location: [703](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=703) ^ref-47011

You’ve got to think about big things while you’re doing small things, so that all the small things go in the right direction. — location: [723](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=723) ^ref-18978

---
A long-term vision or direction helps focus our thinking and doing, because without it proposals are evaluated independently, instead of as part of striving toward something. — location: [724](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=724) ^ref-47693

---
Toyota sees this particular ideal-state condition—if it were achieved through an entire value stream—as the way of manufacturing with the highest quality, at the lowest cost, with the shortest lead time. In recent years Toyota began referring to this as its “true north” for production. — location: [739](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=739) ^ref-39514

---
Remarkably, we still find plenty of organizations that argue internally about whether to accept this endless trend toward 1×1 flow—as if it were something we have the power to control. — location: [769](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=769) ^ref-27910

In other words, it is acceptable and perhaps even desirable for the vision to be a seeming dilemma and thus a challenge. — location: [775](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=775) ^ref-44656

This condition typically represents a step closer to the vision and a challenge that goes somewhat beyond current capability. — location: [798](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=798) ^ref-60487

---
interim target condition is also not a financial or accounting target, but a description of a condition. — location: [800](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=800) ^ref-61064

---
How to achieve that target condition is optional and can tap into what humans are good at: roll-up-your-sleeves effort, resourcefulness, and creativity to achieve new levels of performance. — location: [803](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=803) ^ref-52043

---
The plant manager concurred, and therein lies a significant difference from Toyota. A Toyota plant manager would likely say something like this to the assembly manager: “You are correct that the extra paperwork and first-piece inspection requirements are obstacles to achieving a smaller lot size. Thank you for pointing that out. However, the fact that we want to reduce lot sizes is not optional nor open for discussion, because it moves us closer to our vision of a one-by-one flow. Rather than losing time discussing whether or not we should reduce the lot size, please turn your attention to those two obstacles standing in the way of our progress. Please go observe the current paperwork and inspection processes and report back what you learn. After that I will ask you to make a proposal for how we can move to a one day lot size without increasing our cost.” — location: [821](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=821) ^ref-31680

---
As the sensor cable example illustrates, without a direction we tend to evaluate proposals individually on their own merits, rather than as part of striving toward something. — location: [827](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=827) ^ref-21892

---
This creates that back-and-forth, hunting-for-a-solution, whoever-is-currently-most-persuasive effect in the organization. — location: [829](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=829) ^ref-51498

---
without a sense of direction we tend to use a short-term cost/benefit analysis to decide and choose on a case-by-case basis whether or not something should be done—in which direction to head and what to do—rather than working through challenging obstacles on the way to a new level of performance. — location: [830](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=830) ^ref-53878

---
at Toyota one first determines where one wants or needs to be next—the target condition—and then cost/benefit analysis is utilized to help determine how to get there. — location: [834](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=834) ^ref-52031

---
At Toyota, CBA is used less for deciding whether something should be done, and more for deciding how to do it. — location: [835](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=835) ^ref-9360

---
Do not let financial calculations alone determine your direction, because then the organization becomes inward-looking rather than adaptive, it oscillates on a case-by-case basis rather than striving toward something, and it seeks to find and implement ready solutions rather than developing new smart solutions. — location: [841](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=841) ^ref-35350

Remember, the ability of your company to be competitive and survive lies not so much in solutions themselves, but in the capability of the people in your organization to understand a situation and develop solutions. — location: [866](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=866) ^ref-58022

For example, in the second half of the twentieth century, Detroit automakers opted repeatedly to not significantly enter the market for small cars, even as that market grew noteworthy, because from an ROI-selection perspective it was not profitable. — location: [1001](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=1001) ^ref-58113

According to systems theory, trying to maximize the individual parts of something reduces the effectiveness of the whole. — location: [1008](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=1008) ^ref-47053

---
A process or department becomes even more decoupled from the next process as it strives to produce as much as possible as fast as possible. Since changeovers interrupt production, there is a natural tendency to avoid them and produce large lots. The next process in the value stream does not yet need all those parts that were produced too soon, so the parts must be stored as in-process inventory. (Inventory which is, by the way, counted as an asset by the managerial accounting system.) When the next process finally does use the parts, it will discover defects among them. However, it is impossible to trace the root causes of those defects because the parts were produced some time ago, and the conditions in the preceding process that caused the defects have long since changed. — location: [1014](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=1014) ^ref-10848

This situation repeats over and over all the way through the value stream and results in a total lead time through the factory that is measured in days or weeks, whereas the total value added time is actually only minutes. — location: [1021](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=1021) ^ref-14872

---
improve its pieces-per-man-hour numbers, we only reduce the minutes of value-adding time and do nothing to reduce the days and weeks of lead time. — location: [1023](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=1023) ^ref-61765

---
Such daily adjustments in turn cause even more volatility in the value streams, and soon everyone in the factory becomes almost completely occupied with trying to make the production quantities and shipments. — location: [1032](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=1032) ^ref-17845

Putting the emphasis on departmental output maximization, rather than on optimizing the overall flow for the customer, means that the natural interests of the departmental manager may come into conflict with the long-term survival interests of the company. — location: [1034](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=1034) ^ref-35288

Trying to manage from a distance through data abstractions often results in managers making incorrect assumptions and inappropriate decisions, and trying to make adjustments and adaptations too long after the fact. — location: [1040](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=1040) ^ref-41703

In addition, on-site managers naturally try to make the numbers upon which they are evaluated look good, which means that even less accurate information is reaching the decision makers in the levels above. — location: [1042](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=1042) ^ref-15076

It appears, however, that in subsequent actual business practice and education, MBO became something more like planning and control from above executed to a large degree by setting quantitative targets and assessing reports of metrics. Some call this “management by results.” — location: [1051](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=1051) ^ref-20232

Having a target condition is so important for effective process improvement and management that Toyota will usually not start trying to improve or move forward before a target condition has been defined. This ensures that people’s efforts will be focused on actual needs rather than on various ideas and opinions about what we can do. — location: [1133](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=1133) ^ref-20323

So in a sense takt time represents an ideal repetitive cycle for an assembly process, a cycle at which we would be producing in sync with the customer demand rate—sell one, make one. — location: [1169](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=1169) ^ref-30742

We have an aggregate outcome target, but not a target condition, and we get trapped by such outcome metrics because they prevent us from seeing the actual condition of the process. — location: [1175](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=1175) ^ref-53072

This self-adjusting mechanism is often considered positive, but it is actually a work-around that reveals a “make production” rather than an improvement mind-set. — location: [1256](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=1256) ^ref-3051

Such a mode of operation would not be allowed, and would be viewed as a failure to manage the process. — location: [1258](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=1258) ^ref-6330

If the answer to the question, “Can we run this leveling pattern?” is almost always yes, then Toyota might, for example, reduce the lot size further in order to get back to a situation where the answer is no occasionally. — location: [1331](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NPC0Q2&location=1331) ^ref-19734
