## Highlights
* three common behavioral biases. These include: * The Mere Urgency Effect * The Planning Fallacy * The Present Bias
* Mere Urgency Effect. It dictates that humans choose objectively worse options (email) over objectively better options (client presentations) when â€œthe unimportant tasks are characterized by spurious urgency (e.g. an illusion of expiration).
* In other words: if it looks urgent, we want to get it "off the table" and don't question whether it's actually worth doing.
* First, the trusty Eisenhower Matrix can help distinguish the urgent from the important.
* If itâ€™s your job to eat a frog, itâ€™s best to do it first thing in the morning. And If itâ€™s your job to eat two frogs, itâ€™s best to eat the biggest one first.
* Whatâ€™s something that would be 10x more impactful than checking my mail?
* Meet the Present Bias (the yin to Delayed Gratificationâ€™s yang). This behavioral bias explains our tendency to give stronger weights to payoffs that are closer to the present. Itâ€™s the reason we procrastinate, eat too much sugar, and donâ€™t invest in our retirement accounts.
* Planning Fallacy
* Our tendency to underestimate the time it will take to complete a future task despite knowing that similar tasks have taken longer in the past.
* Taking an outside view: Base your estimates on external sources (like interviews) * Conducting a pre-mortem: Imagine your project was late and work backwards to identify the cause of the delay. * Questioning your motivations: Are there subjective reasons such as internal politics, a personal deadline such as a holiday trip, or external pressure that may lead to unrealistic deadlines?
