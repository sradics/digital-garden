How I follow my Inner Lazy and go AI FIRST  
  
â†’ 8 TED Talks To Master Communication Skill  
â†’ Found it. Stored it. Super fast.  
  
[ChandraKumar R Pillai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chandrakumarpillai/) did post a nice slide deck:  
8 TED Talks To Master Communication Skill  
  
I wanted a list with links of all 8 TED talks  
But it is a slide deck with images.  
Manually search for each talk?  
  
No way! Lazy thinking hat on.  
  
âž  Use AI FIRST thinking instead  
  
ðŸ¤–â€”â€”â€” Prompt for ChatGPT 4o  
Identify all 8 ted talks mentioned. Treat each page in the pdf as an image and then extract text from image. Do this page by page please, first finish one page, search the TED talk online, output your result. Then the next one!  
Finally output all 8 as a bullet point list, including the links - format TED-talk name by Author - link.  
â€”â€”â€”ðŸ¤–  
  
Check the result âž

Learnings:  
â†’ Think about the manual steps. Can you be lazy?  
â†’ How can you describe each step simply?  
â†’ Give it a try with AI. Then iterate.  
â†’ Store the prompt for reuse.
