## Highlights
* The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.
* Sprint Review is Empiricism at work: inspect the Product Increment and adapt the Product Backlog.
* They do not understand the ==importance of the Sprint Review== :Waste of time: Your stakeholders do not feel seen, heard, or respected.
* Missing stakeholder reviews can lead to:
	* ==diminishing level of trust== between the stakeholders on the one side and the Scrum team on the other.
	* stakeholders might be tempted to exert ==more control over the development process by ‚Äútightening the leash,‚Äù== for example, by demanding detailed reports to satisfy their information needs or setting arbitrary deadlines.
* Also helpful is embracing radical transparency regarding what the Scrum team does and over-communication in every aspect. Also, please include them in the product discovery and Product Backlog management processes.
	* ==Shift & Share is an excellent Liberating Structure== microstructure for that purpose.
