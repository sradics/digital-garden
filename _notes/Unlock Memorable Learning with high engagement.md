Unlock Memorable Learning with high engagement!Â ðŸ§   
(How to make content engaging and effective)  
  
Struggling to make your training sessions stick?  
Here are 12 essential principles for effective learning design that we implement in our group coachings.  

âœª Coherence principle: We work with highly relevant content and avoid fancy slide decorations that distract.  
âœª Signaling principle: Key takeaways that pop! We HIGHLIGHT and BOLD what really matters.  
  
âœª Avoid Redundancy principle: We talk it, not type it. Your ears get the info while your eyes get a break.  
âœª Spatial Contiguity principle:Â Related elements placed close for better understanding.  
  
âœª Temporal Contiguity principle: Synced for your senses. We match instructions with models, side by side.  
âœª Pre-Training principle: Know before you go. Key concepts and terms are your first stepping stones.  
  
âœª Modality principle: We balance the spoken word with compelling visuals for an immersive learning experience.  
âœª Multimedia principle: Words meet images.  
  
âœª Segmenting principle: Learning in bite-sized chunks. Every 5 minutes, we check in to make sure you're with us.  
âœª Use human voice principle: Real talk with our awesome Coaches.  
  
âœª Personalization principle: Conversational, friendly, and tailored for you.  
âœª Image principles: Relevant visuals take center stage, because who needs another talking head?

## Content preparation

In order to make content engaging and effective in our group coaching sessions we apply the 12 principles for effective Learning Content. 

12 principles as guidance
+ Coherence principle - eliminate use of irrelevant images and slide decorations
+ Signaling principle - HIGHLIGHT or BOLD essential text or add elements one at a time
+ avoid Redundancy principle - explain it verbally without also providing a textual explanation on a slide
+ Spatial Contiguity principle - place related elements close 
+ Temporal Contiguity principle - present related material simultaneously (e.g. combine instructions in breakout session alongside a model)
+ Pre-Training principle - introduce key concepts/terminology either before or at the start of a session
+ Modality principle - balance how much you say and attendees have to read. We learn best from visuals and spoken words, opposed to visuals and printed words.
+ Multimedia principle - combine e.g. words and images
+ Segmenting principle - break content into segments. With a meaningful interaction every 5 minutes - to access understanding 
+ Use human voice principle - implemented by using coaching and facilitation by our awesome Coaches
+ Personalization principle - use conversational language
+ Image principles - Â Show relevant visuals on the screen instead of a talking head.
