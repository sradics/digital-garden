Unlock Your Potential with Mindful Productivity âš¡  
(Discover PARI)  
  
Tired of feeling stuck? I discovered the key to constant growth!  
  
Meet PARI: the mindful practice for productivity and personal growth. It's a mindset shift that'll set your daily routine on fire. ðŸ”¥  
â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾  
âœª PACT: Commit to repetitions towards reaching your goal  
âœª ACT: Block out time  
âœª REACT: Track your progress, accept plateaus, and keep your goal in sight.  
âœª IMPACT: Link it to a higher level goal and get out of your comfort zone  

Here's how I applied PARI to my daily push-ups and what it taught me:  
  
My PACT is a promise to myselfâ€”to never skip a day in building my core strength.  
The ACT is MY time each morning. Tiny, consistent steps, always with achievable goals, inspired by David Goggins' resilience.  
REACT is reflection timeâ€”note the progress, understand the highs and lows, and adjust accordingly. It's about recognizing that fluctuation is part of the journey.  
And the IMPACT? It's about connecting the dots between physical strength and overall well-being, ensuring that this practice isn't just about fitness but about paving the way to [hashtag#Longevity](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=longevity&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7175053272204881920).  
  
PARI is my loop of growth, and my commitment to not only dream about a future of longevity but to create it, one push-up at a time. ðŸ’ª

## Content preparation
I have my mind framed with growth loops and constant feedback.

I use the PARI system, a mindful productivity practice that applies mindframing and combines working with a Growth Mindset, Metacognition and Self-Authorship.

Applied to my daily push up routine:
+ with my PACT being committed to invest in my core physical strength every day
+ my ACT to have time blocked every morning to exercise, covered with my mental model of tiny steps, pushing for what is possible that day, stretching it with Goggins in mind
+ my REACT to capture daily progress and learn about plateaus, reaching new levels and looking at the development long term and accepting fluctuations in daily form
+ my IMPACT to connect my core strength to longevity, to have this strength exercise embedded on my bigger physical and mental health fitness program.

With PARI I care about winning repeatedly and building my core strength to pave my path to longevity.
