# [[Unused Learning Budget]]
## LinkedIn Post
[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_you-are-part-of-the-1-billion-learning-activity-7317426447877304321-Oh9i?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAA1M1pkBgWCYPhT45EpfLiHzViQqRWNCIv4)

  You are part of the $1 Billion+ Learning Budget Paradox  
  
â†’ 40% of learning budgets die unused.  
  
I observed a strange behavior in the corporate world:  
  
Companies offer learning budgets (typically â‚¬500-1500 per employee).  
But a shocking 40% goes completely unused each year.  
  
"Companies spending more than $340 billion on employee training and development globally" ... that is a lot in learning opportunities that simply expire.  
  
Why does this happen?  
  
â†’ "I'm too busy right now"  
(yet somehow never less busy later)  
  
â†’ "I can't find the right course"  
(analysis paralysis)  
  
â†’ "I'll use it next quarter"  
(until next becomes never)  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
But there's a deeper issue:Â Most professionals don't have a system to actually implement what they learn.  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
Think about it:  
â†’ You take a course  
â†’ You feel motivated during the training  
â†’ You return to work  
â†’ The materials sit untouched in a folder  
â†’ The insights fade within weeks  
  
âž  The ROI approaches zero  
  
What if instead of just consuming more information,  
you invested in your meta-skill â€“ learning how to learn?  
  
When you build a system to capture, organize,  
and actually use what you learn:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Insights compound rather than fade  
â†’ Every future course becomes 3-5x more valuable  
â†’ Your knowledge becomes retrievable exactly when needed  
  
Your learning budget creates actual career leverage  
  
With my "Learning Ecosystem Mastery" program you'll create your  
AI-enhanced knowledge system that  
â†’ captures everything important  
â†’ finds anything instantly  
â†’ leads to applying knowledge faster than ever.  
  
And yes, it fits within most corporate learning budgets.  
  
Inaugural cohort starts April 28th.

What's your experience with corporate learning budgets?  
Do you use yours fully each year?
