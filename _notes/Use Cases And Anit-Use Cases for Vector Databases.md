# Use Cases And Anit-Use Cases for Vector Databases


### **10 Examples of Proper Activities with a Vector Database**

1. **Semantic Search:** Powering **a search engine that understands the ==_meaning_== behind a query, not just the keywords.** For example, a search for "best pizza restaurant" could return results for "top-rated pizzerias". Â 
    
    - **Reason:** Vector databases excel at finding results that are conceptually similar by comparing the proximity of vector embeddings, which capture semantic meaning. Â 
        
2. **Recommendation Engines:** **Suggesting products, movies, or music** to users **based on their preferences and behavior.** Â 
    
    - **Reason:** User preferences and item attributes can be converted into vectors. The database can then **quickly find items whose vectors are closest to a user's preference** vector. Â 
        
3. **Image and Visual Search:** Allowing a user to **search for visually similar images** by uploading a picture. Â 
    
    - **Reason:** Images are converted into vector embeddings that represent their visual features. The database can then perform a similarity search to find other images with comparable vector representations. Â 
        
4. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** **Providing a Large Language Model (LLM) with relevant, up-to-date, or domain-specific context** to improve its answers and reduce "hallucinations". Â 
    
    - **Reason:** A user's query is used to perform a similarity search on a vector database containing an organization's private documents. The most relevant results are fed to the LLM as context, grounding its response in factual data. Â 
        
5. **Anomaly and Fraud Detection:** Identifying unusual patterns of behavior that may indicate fraudulent activity. Â 
    
    - **Reason:** Normal behavior patterns are stored as vectors. New activities are compared against these patterns, and significant deviations (distant vectors) are flagged as potential anomalies. Â 
        
6. **Multimodal Search:** Searching across different types of data with a single query, such as using a text description to find a relevant image or audio clip. Â 
    
    - **Reason:** **Different data types (text, images, audio) can be represented in the same vector space**, allowing for cross-modal similarity comparisons. Â 
        
7. **Drug Discovery and Genomics:** Finding molecular structures or genetic patterns that are similar to a target compound. Â 
    
    - **Reason:** Complex biological structures can be represented as high-dimensional vectors, enabling rapid similarity searches that can accelerate research. Â 
        
8. **Personalized Advertising:** Matching user profiles with the most relevant advertisements. Â 
    
    - **Reason:** User behaviors and ad characteristics are converted into vectors, and the database finds the closest matches to serve personalized ads. Â 
        
9. **Question-Answering Systems:** **Finding the most relevant passages of text** from a large knowledge base to answer a user's specific question. Â 
    
    - **Reason:** The system vectorizes the question and searches for text chunks with the most similar vector embeddings, which are likely to contain the answer. Â 
        
10. **Clustering and Classification:** **Automatically grouping similar data points** together without pre-defined labels. Â 
    
    - **Reason:** The database's **ability to measure similarity** allows it to efficiently group data points based on the proximity of their vectors.

### **10 Examples of What Not to Do with a Vector Database**

1. **Processing Financial Transactions:** Using it to manage a bank transfer where money is debited from one account and credited to another.
    
    - **Reason:** **Vector databases lack ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)** compliance, which is essential for guaranteeing that transactions are processed reliably and data integrity is maintained. Â 
        
2. **Serving as a Primary System of Record:** **Storing critical, structured application data like user accounts, order histories, or inventory levels.**
    
    - **Reason:** They are not designed to be general-purpose databases and lack the robust data management, integrity, and consistency guarantees of traditional SQL or NoSQL databases. Â 
        
3. **Performing ==Complex Relational Joins==:** Combining data from multiple tables based on foreign key relationships, such as linking a `customers` table with an `orders` table.
    
    - **Reason:** The data model is not relational. Vector databases lack the concepts of tables, rows, and foreign keys required to perform joins. Â 
        
4. **Running Aggregation Queries:** Calculating the total sales per region (`SUM` and `GROUP BY`) for a business report.
    
    - **Reason:** Their **==indexes are optimized to avoid scanning the entire dataset==**. Forcing an aggregation would bypass this optimization, leading to **highly inefficient performance** compared to a traditional database. Â 
        
5. **Exact Keyword Matching:** **==Searching for a specific, unique product ID like "A2848"==** or a rare technical term where precision is critical.
    
    - **Reason:** **Vector search is designed for semantic similarity, not lexical identity.** **==It may generalize the term and return conceptually similar but inexact results.==** Â 
        
6. **High-Throughput Transactional (OLTP) Workloads:** Powering an e-commerce checkout system that processes thousands of concurrent orders.
    
    - **Reason:** They are optimized for read-heavy similarity searches, not the high volume of short, write-heavy transactions that characterize OLTP systems. Â 
        
7. **Ensuring Strong Data Consistency:** Guaranteeing that a write operation is instantly visible across all system replicas, as required in a stock trading platform.
    
    - **Reason:** Vector databases often prioritize availability and low latency, operating on an "eventual consistency" model where data may be temporarily stale across replicas. Â 
        
8. **Handling Negative or Exclusionary Queries:** Trying to find "all animals except cats."
    
    - **Reason:** The nature of semantic search means **==including the term "cats" in the query will actually increase the similarity score for cat-related results, making it difficult to exclude them effectively.==** Â 
        
9. **Storing and Querying Highly Structured Data:** Managing a traditional employee database with columns for name, ID, salary, and start date.
    
    - **Reason:** The architecture is optimized for handling high-dimensional vector data, not for efficiently storing and querying structured data in rows and columns. Â 
        
10. **Replacing a Full-Text Search Engine for Keyword-Heavy Tasks:** Building a legal document search where finding every instance of a specific keyword is mandatory.
    
    - **Reason:** While they can be part of a hybrid search system, their core strength is semantic relevance. For tasks demanding pure, high-precision keyword retrieval, a dedicated full-text search engine like Elasticsearch is better suited.
