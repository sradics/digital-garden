## **OKR Review**

====OKR stands for objectives and key results. They combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome.¬†

## **Benefits of setting personal OKRs**

Many of us set New Year‚Äôs resolutions each year, only to find that by February, we are not much closer to accomplishing those goals than we were on January 1st. ==Setting personal OKRs is a strategy that can help you define clear, measurable goals for yourself and create an action plan for achieving them==. Just like with company- or project-level OKRs, setting ==personal OKRs can turn vague and ambiguous goals into quantifiable and measurable metrics==. Whether it‚Äôs a personal fitness goal, a desire to spend more time with your family, or a goal to complete this certificate program, setting personal OKRs for these goals can make it easier to track their progress and determine when you‚Äôve achieved them.¬†

## **Write your own OKRs**

Follow the steps outlined below to help you craft your own personal OKRs.¬†==You can use this [OKR template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jRK5I_uI92hJG5efVYlY33ZrExtcx9KMkgWWVQNipKc/template/preview?resourcekey=0--0jhg573V_kexTynrd2U6g "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jRK5I_uI92hJG5efVYlY33ZrExtcx9KMkgWWVQNipKc/template/preview?resourcekey=0--0jhg573V_kexTynrd2U6g")==, 

## **Define your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù**

Before you start on your objectives‚Äîyour ‚Äúwhat‚Äù‚Äîconsider your ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù This is your mission. ==Why are you setting goals?== For example, if you have a goal to complete this course, why is that important to you? ==Write that down and use it to inspire and focus your objectives.==

## **Determine your ‚Äúwhat‚Äù**

### Brainstorm possible objectives

Now that you have a clear sense of why these goals are important to you, you can start drafting your objectives. ==Think about the things you most want or need to accomplish in the next 30‚Äì90 days.==¬†

To help you generate a list of possible objectives, consider the following:

-   What are the most important things I need to get done?
-   What do I need to take action on?¬†
-   What do I need to start doing or changing?
-   What do I want to improve or work on in my life or career?

Based on your responses to these questions, brainstorm a list of 3‚Äì5 possible objectives that relate to your mission.

### Refine your objectives

Review your list of possible objectives and revise them to make sure they meet the following criteria:

-   **Aspirational**: Is the objective inspiring and motivational? Does it ask you to challenge yourself and accomplish something you haven‚Äôt before?
-   **Aligned with organizational goals**: In this case, YOU are the organization, so your objectives should align with the mission you defined earlier. Does the objective help you in achieving your overall goals?
-   **Action-oriented**: Does the objective indicate making a change or taking action?
-   **Concrete**: Is the objective clearly stated? Would someone else understand what the objective is hoping to accomplish?
-   **Significant**: Will achieving the objective make a significant impact toward your personal or professional development?

## **Develop the ‚Äúhow‚Äù**

Next, it‚Äôs time to ==add key results, which describe how you‚Äôll achieve your objective==. They also define what it means to successfully meet your objective.¬†

### Draft and refine your key results

Working with one objective at a time, brainstorm a list of 2‚Äì5 key results. To help you generate your list, consider the following:
-   ==How would you define success for this objective?==    
-   What metrics would prove that you‚Äôve successfully achieved the objective?
    

Once you have a few key results, review and revise them so they meet the following criteria:

-   **Results-oriented**‚Äînot a task: Do the key results state the overall outcome, rather than individual steps to get there?
-   **Measurable and verifiable**: Do the key results include specific, objective metrics?
-   **Specific and time-bound**: Have you clearly defined what needs to happen and by when?
-   **Aggressive yet realistic**: Do the stated results stretch you but still account for potential challenges or unexpected events that could arise?

Some examples for key results:
+ Attend a public speaking workshop by the end of the 1st quarter.
+ Watch at least one TEDTalk per week.
+ Deliver one presentation every two months and collect feedback

+ Block out 90 minutes each day to work on top-priority tasks
+ Delegate items to other team members to focus my time on higher priority tasks.
+ Take on one additional project this quarter while maintaining the same number of work hours.
