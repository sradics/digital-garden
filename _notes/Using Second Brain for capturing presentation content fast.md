# [[Using Second Brain for capturing presentation content fast ]]

Based on a great presentation by David about Discovering hidden assumptions I used Obsidian to fast capture my learnings from his workshop. 
+ show how I connected learnings
+ show how I used several stages from building a second brain
+ show how easy that was - time 15' plus
	+ all prepared within my environment
	+ next time it will be fast to reconnect to these learnings
+ show how I shared my insights immediately
