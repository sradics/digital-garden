Vibe-coding feels like magic. Until it doesn't.  
  
â†’ What I learned after experimenting for days  
  
Green-field projects are incredible.  
  
Fast results. Watching your app grow before your eyes. Low credit usage.  
  
It feels like the future of development.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
But here's what happens as your codebase matures:  
  
Bug-fixing iterations multiply exponentially.  
  
Credits burn through your account.  
  
What felt effortless becomes expensive and frustrating.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
The difference maker? Developer experience.  
  
I can read the generated code. Understand where problems emerge. Guide the AI's direction.  
  
But app builders without coding knowledge?  
  
They're flying blind while their costs skyrocket.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
Some patterns I notice  
  
â†’ Take tiny, specific steps  
â†’ Commit frequently so you can roll back  
â†’ Review code changes (requires dev knowledge)  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
My current take:  
  
Vibe-coding isn't ready for non-developers with complex projects.  
  
Even experienced developers need to relearn their workflow.  
  
It's like being a beginner again - but with expensive mistakes.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
What's your experience with AI coding tools?  
  
Are you seeing similar patterns?
