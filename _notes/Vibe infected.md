Don't pay gazillions. Build it yourself.

AI didn't just help me code. It demolished the barrier to building.

After building my AI assistant suite with Lovable, I wanted to go deeper.

So over the weekend, I jumped into Cursor.

My challenge ...
———
→ I need Landing Pages and workflows for my products and services
→ I want to manage my customer journeys efficiently

→ Without paying “gazillions” for mediocre tools
→ Without losing control over workflows

I guess that's a good, ambitious challenge to build yourself, right?

48 hours. 200M tokens. 400+ AI dialogs later:

→ My own (basic) landing page builder
→ A customer base with Kit newsletter integration

What once took weeks… now: a weekend.

Zooming out:
———
AI lowers the bar for building your own tools.

You can integrate, automate, and stay in full control:

CRM ↔ Kit ↔ LinkedIn ↔ SamCart ↔ Stripe — all talking to each other.

Platforms selling “OK” features for high prices? 
... They should be nervous.

Have you tried vibe coding and built your own tool yet?
