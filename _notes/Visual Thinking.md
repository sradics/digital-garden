How I think visually inside my Second Brain  
  
â†’ Bring all your thoughts in one place  
  
Yesterday I published an interview with Frank and mentionedÂ visual thinking with Excalidraw  
â†’ details - [https://lnkd.in/ea46bXxh](https://lnkd.in/ea46bXxh)  
  
Let's zoom in today!  
  
Imagine you want to combine  
  
â†’ Summaries you created.  
â†’ Images you collected.  
â†’ Notes you took.  
  
And you want to add your thoughts.  
Thinking that happens all in one place.  
  
In this video, you can see my Five Lightbulbs Messaging Map.  
  
It shows the Messaging Map in a visual representation.  
  
I added my distilled summary from [Billy Broas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billybroas/) book Simple Marketing for Smart people. (I use this for a reference to check my understanding of the method)  
  
The Map contains details about Bill Broas'  
The Five Lightbulbs framework.  
(Again for easy reference to remember the approach)  
  
I can think and at the same time reference the material that helps me thinking. All in one place.  
  
You can do that by combining:  
â†’ Taking notes in Obsidian  
â†’ Visual Thinking in Excalidraw, that is embedded in Obsidian.  
  
Isn't that a next level of working with your thoughts?  
  
What do you think?
