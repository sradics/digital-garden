# Visualize my Knowledge Portfolio as T-Shaped graph

Idea is to use my [[31.01 Knowledge Portfolio]] and create a visualization in Excalidraw that displays my expertise areas and also shows the level of T expertise in certain aspects.

Further thoughts:
+ link an element in the graph to MOCs or knowledge notes in Obsidian
+ use a scale 1..10 for the expertise level of a topics
+ check connection with nice knowledge clustering from [[21 Important Skills]] and [[Top 10 Skills of 2025]]
	+ the competency bundles might be worth coloring or tagging
	+ the competencies can be special points on the T-Shape
	+ the important skill aspects can become special filters I can use to look at skills I'm good at ... connected with skills needed
+ I can use that for self marketing, but also as a model for coaching and others to learn
