My Ghostwriter charges $9.99 per month

â†’ Speak your mind while you walk

Do you sometimes take a walk alone?
Do you then experience a stream of thoughts appearing?

Our brain connects impressions. 
I want to catch thoughts like these. 
They make great ideas for my next LinkedIn post

What if you can capture such thoughts easily?
If this content is already written for you?

Voicepal might be an app you should try.
I've been using it for two weeks, and I love it. 

Voicepal helps me to:
â†’ Just speak my mind. It records my voice.
â†’ It then immediately converts to text.

You say: That is simple, many other apps do that.

But wait:
â†’ Voicepal then immediately ask smart follow-up questions
â†’ So you can further elaborate on your thoughts
â†’ Either just in that moment, or a day, a week, or a month later

Now it gets interesting, right?

But wait, there is more!
Once you finished your stream of thoughts:

â†’ You can convert it to a LinkedIn post, a X post, a newsletter, a video script, ...
â†’ And it follows a template you provide. 

Through such a template Voicepal learns about your style. 

Just on my walk yesterday I created 6 drafts for next posts. 

Simple: Walk â†’ Talk â†’ Draft

I experience these four key benefits:

â†’ Flexibility: 
I capture thoughts when they appear

â†’ Efficiency: 
You quickly generate drafts with minimal editing

â†’ Simplicity: 
You can speak freely, unstructured. Voicepal adds structure.

â†’ Creativity: 
These really smart, contextual follow up questions provoke deeper thinking.

What is your approach to to capturing your thoughts?

I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease
