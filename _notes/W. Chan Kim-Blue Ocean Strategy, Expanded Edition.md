---
To focus on the red ocean is therefore to accept the key constraining factors of war—limited terrain and the need to beat an enemy to succeed—and to deny the distinctive strength of the business world: the capacity to create new market space that is uncontested. — location: [327](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=327) ^ref-35854

86 percent of the launches were line extensions, that is, incremental improvements — location: [331](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=331) ^ref-9361

The remaining 14 percent of the launches were aimed at creating blue oceans. They generated 38 percent of total revenues and 61 percent of total profits. — location: [332](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=332) ^ref-10009

The result has been accelerated commoditization of products and services, increasing price wars, and shrinking profit margins. — location: [346](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=346) ^ref-43402

Value Innovation: The Cornerstone of Blue Ocean Strategy — location: [411](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=411) ^ref-9082

---
The companies caught in the red ocean followed a conventional approach, racing to beat the competition by building a defensible position within the existing industry order. — location: [412](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=412) ^ref-7030

---
Instead, they followed a different strategic logic that we call value innovation. — location: [414](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=414) ^ref-31309

---
you focus on making the competition irrelevant by creating a leap in value for buyers and your company, thereby opening up new and uncontested market space. — location: [416](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=416) ^ref-20007

---
Value without innovation tends to focus on value creation on an incremental scale, something that improves value but is not sufficient to make you stand out in the marketplace. — location: [418](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=418) ^ref-24561

---
Innovation without value tends to be technology-driven, market pioneering, or futuristic, often shooting beyond what buyers are ready to accept and pay for. — location: [419](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=419) ^ref-16508

---
positions. If they fail to anchor innovation with value in this way, technology innovators and market pioneers often lay the eggs that other companies hatch. — location: [424](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=424) ^ref-35001

---
Value innovation is a new way of thinking about and executing strategy that results in the creation of a blue ocean and a break from the competition. — location: [425](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=425) ^ref-30185

---
This included trying to secure more famous clowns and lion tamers, a strategy that raised circuses’ cost structure without substantially altering the circus experience. — location: [432](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=432) ^ref-54453

---
Instead of following the conventional logic of outpacing the competition by offering a better solution to the given problem—creating a circus with even greater fun and thrills—it sought to offer people the fun and thrill of the circus and the intellectual sophistication and artistic richness of the theater at the same time; hence, it redefined the problem itself. — location: [435](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=435) ^ref-54355

---
a new understanding not only of circus customers but also of circus noncustomers: — location: [439](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=439) ^ref-35543

---
Value innovation is created in the region where a company’s actions favorably affect both its cost structure and its value proposition to buyers. Cost savings are made by eliminating and reducing the factors an industry competes on. Buyer value is lifted by raising and creating elements the industry has never offered. Over time, costs are reduced further as scale economies kick in due to the high sales volumes that superior value generates. — location: [473](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=473) ^ref-13054

---
the creation of blue oceans is about driving costs down while simultaneously driving value up for buyers. — location: [478](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=478) ^ref-17068

---
Value innovation requires companies to orient the whole system toward achieving a leap in value for both buyers and themselves. — location: [489](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=489) ^ref-59390

it had long competed on seven principal factors: — location: [607](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=607) ^ref-60136

A high score means that a company offers buyers more, and hence invests more, in that factor. — location: [616](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=616) ^ref-16815

---
Nor is conducting extensive customer research the path to blue oceans. — location: [629](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=629) ^ref-23917

---

and from customers to noncustomers of the industry. — location: [633](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=633) ^ref-37528

Conventional strategic logic, by contrast, drives you to offer better solutions than your rivals to existing problems defined by your industry. — location: [636](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=636) ^ref-1142

underlying blue oceans: the four actions framework. — location: [647](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=647) ^ref-53081

---
there are four key questions to challenge an industry’s strategic logic and business model: — location: [650](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=650) ^ref-8711

---
Which of the factors that the industry takes for granted should be eliminated? — location: [651](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=651) ^ref-54049

---
Which factors should be reduced well below the industry’s standard? — location: [652](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=652) ^ref-56575

---
Which factors should be raised well above the industry’s standard? — location: [653](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=653) ^ref-56975

---
Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered? — location: [653](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=653) ^ref-38774

---
value. Sometimes there is a fundamental change in what buyers value, but companies that are focused on benchmarking one another do not act on, — location: [658](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=658) ^ref-36391

---
whether products or services have been overdesigned in the race to match and beat the competition. — location: [659](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=659) ^ref-57469

---
increasing their cost structure for no gain. — location: [660](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=660) ^ref-44202

---
It is by pursuing the first two questions (of eliminating and reducing) that you gain insight into how to drop your cost structure vis-à-vis competitors. — location: [663](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=663) ^ref-18232

---
The second two factors, by contrast, provide you with insight into how to lift buyer value and create new demand. — location: [665](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=665) ^ref-8353

leapfrogged tall competitors with no promotional campaign, mass media, or consumer advertising for the initial years. It didn’t simply steal sales from competitors; it grew the market. — location: [680](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=680) ^ref-38813

Casella Wines acted on all four actions—eliminate, reduce, raise, and create—to — location: [687](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=687) ^ref-27229

It is a supplementary analytic to the four actions framework called the eliminate-reduce-raise-create grid (see figure 2-4). — location: [732](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=732) ^ref-29744

---
[yellow tail]’s value curve has focus; the company did not diffuse its efforts across all key factors of competition. — location: [756](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=756) ^ref-55112

---
then, an effective blue ocean strategy like [yellow tail]’s has three complementary qualities: focus, divergence, and a compelling tagline. — location: [760](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=760) ^ref-26181

---
When a company’s strategy is formed reactively as it tries to keep up with the competition, it loses its uniqueness. — location: [780](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=780) ^ref-42994

compelling tagline. “The speed of a plane at the price of a car—whenever you need it.” — location: [787](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=787) ^ref-64199

---
When a company’s value curve, or its competitors’, meets the three criteria that define a good blue ocean strategy—focus, divergence, and a compelling tagline that speaks to the market—the company is on the right track. — location: [810](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=810) ^ref-21556

might be interesting for the stock market too

---
When a company’s value curve converges with its competitors, it signals that a company is likely caught within the red ocean of bloody competition. — location: [816](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=816) ^ref-4244

---
Are there strategic contradictions? These are areas where a company is offering a high level on one competing factor while ignoring others that support that factor. — location: [825](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=825) ^ref-59974

---
For example, a petroleum station company found that it offered “less for more”: fewer services than the best competitor at a higher price. — location: [828](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=828) ^ref-42564

---
Are the competing factors stated in terms buyers can understand and value, or are they in operational jargon? — location: [832](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=832) ^ref-46472

Reconstruct Market Boundaries — location: [844](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=844) ^ref-62647

successfully identify, out of the haystack of possibilities that exist, commercially compelling blue ocean opportunities. — location: [846](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=846) ^ref-54639

---
These six assumptions, on which most companies hypnotically build their strategies, keep companies trapped competing in red oceans. Specifically, companies tend to do the following: — location: [855](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=855) ^ref-27179

---
Define their industry similarly and focus on being the best within it — location: [856](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=856) ^ref-33516

---
Look at their industries through the lens of generally accepted strategic groups (such as luxury automobiles, economy cars, and family vehicles), and strive to stand out in the strategic group they play in Focus on the same buyer group, be it the purchaser (as in the office equipment industry), the user (as in the clothing industry), or the influencer (as in the pharmaceutical industry) Define the scope of the products and services offered by their industry similarly Accept their industry’s functional or emotional orientation Focus on the same point in time—and often on current competitive threats—in formulating strategy — location: [857](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=857) ^ref-22197

---
On the other hand, alternatives include products or services that have different functions and forms but the same purpose. — location: [870](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=870) ^ref-23760

---
The software, the CPA, the pencil and financial apps are largely substitutes for each other. They have very different forms but serve the same function: helping people manage their financial affairs. — location: [873](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=873) ^ref-10882

---
Despite the differences in form and function, however, people go to a restaurant for the same objective that they go to the movies: to enjoy a night out. — location: [877](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=877) ^ref-43212

---
Rarely do sellers think consciously about how their customers make trade-offs across alternative industries. A shift in price, a change in model, even a new ad campaign can elicit a tremendous response from rivals within an industry, but the same actions in an alternative industry usually go unnoticed. — location: [881](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=881) ^ref-41925

super interesting for further marketing angles

---
however, the space between alternative industries provides opportunities for value innovation. — location: [884](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=884) ^ref-64664

we should deeper analyse our alternatives (HW is just a substitute)

---
What are the alternative industries to your industry? Why do customers trade across them? — location: [962](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=962) ^ref-42978

---
Path 2: Look Across Strategic Groups within Industries — location: [965](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=965) ^ref-38032

looking across strategic groups. The term refers to a group of companies within an industry that pursue a similar strategy. In — location: [966](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=966) ^ref-41289

---
Strategic groups can generally be ranked in a rough hierarchical order built on two dimensions: price and performance. — location: [968](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=968) ^ref-18955

---
Curves built its blue ocean by drawing on the distinctive strengths of these two strategic groups, eliminating and reducing everything else (see figure 3-2 — location: [999](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=999) ^ref-22930

What are the strategic groups in your industry? Why do customers trade up for the higher group, and why do they trade down for the lower one? — location: [1035](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1035) ^ref-64988

---
Look Across the Chain of Buyers — location: [1037](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1037) ^ref-23710

---
The purchasers who pay for the product or service may differ from the actual users, and in some cases there are important influencers as well. — location: [1039](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1039) ^ref-23931

---
Challenging an industry’s conventional wisdom about which buyer group to target can lead to the discovery of a new blue ocean. — location: [1047](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1047) ^ref-3738

Need to convert to challenging questions

---
By questioning conventional definitions of who can and should be the target buyer, companies can often see fundamentally new ways to unlock value. — location: [1092](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1092) ^ref-47026

---
What is the chain of buyers in your industry? Which buyer group does your industry typically focus on? — location: [1096](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1096) ^ref-2922

---
If you shifted the buyer group of your industry, how could you unlock new value? — location: [1097](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1097) ^ref-20427

---
Path 4: Look Across Complementary Product and Service Offerings — location: [1098](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1098) ^ref-474

Connection Obsidian and blinkist

---
The ease and cost of getting a babysitter and parking the car affect the perceived value of going to the movies. Yet these complementary services are beyond the bounds of the movie theater industry as it has been traditionally defined. — location: [1100](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1100) ^ref-49601

---
A simple way to do so is to think about what happens before, during, and after your product is used. — location: [1104](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1104) ^ref-23319

What is the context in which your product or service is used? What happens before, during, and after? — location: [1155](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1155) ^ref-493

---
How can you eliminate these pain points through a complementary product or service offering? — location: [1156](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1156) ^ref-60409

---
Some industries compete principally on price and function largely on calculations of utility; their appeal is rational. Other industries compete largely on feelings; their appeal is emotional. — location: [1159](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1159) ^ref-57240

---
Companies’ behavior affects buyers’ expectations in a reinforcing cycle. — location: [1162](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1162) ^ref-10940

---
No wonder market research rarely reveals new insights into what attracts customers. Industries have trained customers on what to expect. When surveyed, they echo back: more of the same for less. — location: [1163](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1163) ^ref-25433

---
When companies are willing to challenge the functional-emotional orientation of their industry, they often find new market space. — location: [1165](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1165) ^ref-680

---
Emotionally oriented industries offer many extras that add price without enhancing functionality. Stripping away those extras may create a fundamentally simpler, lower-priced, lower-cost business model that customers would welcome. Conversely, functionally oriented industries can often infuse commodity products with new life by adding a dose of emotion and, in so doing, can stimulate new demand. — location: [1166](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1166) ^ref-26915

---
So QB House stripped away the emotional service elements of hot towels, shoulder rubs, and tea and coffee. — location: [1180](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1180) ^ref-55042

---
Does your industry compete on functionality or emotional appeal? — location: [1237](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1237) ^ref-60866

---
If you compete on emotional appeal, what elements can you strip out to make it functional? If you compete on functionality, what elements can be added to make it emotional? — location: [1238](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1238) ^ref-23106

trends that affect their businesses over time. — location: [1240](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1240) ^ref-1652

---
But key insights into blue ocean strategy rarely come from projecting the trend itself. Instead they arise from business insights into how the trend will change value to customers and impact the company’s business model. — location: [1245](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1245) ^ref-64069

To achieve this, companies should challenge two conventional strategy practices. One is the focus on existing customers. The other is the drive for finer segmentation to accommodate buyer differences. — location: [1574](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1574) ^ref-35377

Typically, to grow their share of a market, companies strive to retain and expand existing customers. This often leads to finer segmentation and greater tailoring of offerings to better meet customer preferences. The more intense the competition is, the greater, on average, is the resulting customization of offerings. — location: [1575](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1575) ^ref-1312
