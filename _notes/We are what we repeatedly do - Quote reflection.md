The quote by the way is by Durant and goes like this:  
  
‚Äú‚Ä¶we are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then is not an act but a habit.‚Äù  
  
Based on Aristotle: ‚Äúthese virtues are formed in man by his doing the actions‚Äù  
  
(Which is really empowering by brining great capabilities into our reach if we chose so)
