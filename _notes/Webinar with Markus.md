# Webinar with Markus
+ Share what he is doing and why he think it is working with Markus
+ (happy to help with orchestration) (also with chat)
+ You are what you repeatedly do!
	+ you need to exercise
+ cool story with the runner
+ **consistency**
+ 1 frequency, 2 volume, 3 differentiation
+ message - strategy is always there! -- here consistency connects
+ vs adhoc strategy
+ vs big effort strategy
+ Strategy as Fluff (even does not sustain the negative/reverse statement)
+ must be behavior-shaping!
	+ you need to decompile the message
+ problem with decoupled strategy
+ strategy helps to explain decisions
	+ it needs to make sense by providing coherence and clarity
	+ orienting on Long Term goal - mapping what we do and ways to reach that goal
	+ helps to make sense of progress and trade-offs
+ AIM: create clarity on all levels
+ often corporate/enterprise strategy and their example does not help
+ bottom-up communication is difficult (and needs practice)
+ often main problem: meta about what does vision-mission-... mean ... high learning effort in the beginning kills momentum
+ Play to Win!! 
	+ iterative
	+ emergent
	+ use lower level learning curve
	+ Winning aspiration?,
	+ Where to play?
	+ How to play?
+ Concept of pace layering
	+ need to consider and respect that we will work with different speeds
+ Marker - Options - Work framework to replace loaded wording ... and immediately start with the work

ðŸ“– How big things are done

Tiny start with 2h workshops ...

+ Strategy is emergent
+ is ubiquitous
+ as inclusive
+ is transparent
+ creates clarity
+ cares about the long term
+ does not rely on one single tool

Strategy investment of executives is very low.  (95% don't do it)

So, if you start it, you can get to the top quite fast.

+ Marker - Option - Work
+ Play to Win

Pillars of Strategy
+ Framework (e.g. Marker - Options - Work)
+ Communication
+ Creativity (to create new options)
	+ the obvious things likely won't make it

Who we are - Identity 
- changes rarely 
- **markers** - slow and stable, sometimes we need to change
	- you need people accountable for that, to early on discover important needs to adjust. Often they then need to change fast


What we have to do
+ **work**
	+ flow

Decisions 
+ **options**
	+ diverse, choice
	+ options don't need to flow
	+ we need to be super flexible here

Often the biggest level is on marker and option level.

You need clarity on level of options.

Options
- discussion on qualitative level is often difficult


Example:

Resolution partially very low in the slides shown

Options:
- near to financial ones
- you don't need to exercise them
- the might run out of value
- avoid early commitment 
- search low risk (low downside), high impact (high upside)

Strategy is often scary in the middle 


In summary:
* Play to Win strategy canvas
+ discuss things weekly with the canvas
+ it is not a linear process


High cadence!!
Options, Marker - weekly 15' -- to make problems visibe
Options Work - 30'
stay below threshold!
Cadence>Creation

urgency

creating Options are the toughest part

12 weeks to cover a topic!
