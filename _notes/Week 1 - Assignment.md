# Week 1 - Assignment

**Time to get to work: $10K Task Audit**

## Step 1: Task Dump
Write down all the things that you currently are working on, that you should be working on or that you want to work on

## Step 2: Assign a $10K Value

- Label all the tasks that you could do hungover with `$10`
- Next, scan your list for those activities that would be 10x as impactful. Those are your `$100` tasks.
- One step further down the line, it's time to think about things that are 100x more impactful. A good rule of thumb: tasks that require a special skillset. These are `$1000` tasks.
- Lastly, $10K work. It's hard to pin down, but a good starting point is this question: if I think about where I want to be in 1, 5 or 10 years, what will actually get me there?

## Step 3: Pick a $10K Task to work on
Now take a look at your $10K tasks. Each day, commit 25 minutes to work on one of those tasks.
