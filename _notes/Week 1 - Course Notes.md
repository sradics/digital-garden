# Week 1 - Course Notes
Course: [Learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) by Dr. Barbara Oakley, Dr. Terrence Sejnowski
Course claim: **Learn more effectively and with less frustration**

## Focussed and Diffused mode
We are either in focussed or in diffused mode. Not in both at the same time.
### Focussed mode
Analogy - pinball machine. Knowledge blocks that are familiar are tight together. This can be **used when you work on something familiar**. 

### Diffused Mode
Widely spaces connectors, so that **thoughts can bounce** around. 
**Look broadly from a wider range/big picture perspective** (and drill down to focussed mode if necessary)

### Using the different thinking modes
**Dali** - went into diffuse mode, **key in hand** and when he was short before falling asleep he stopped and carried away his thought to be used in the next deep focus mode and build on it.

So **when learning something new** ... our **mind needs to go back and forth between the two different learning modes**. Do **a little work every day** (like with muscles).

### Takeways
* **==metaphors and analogies==** provide powerful techniques for learning
* **==diffuse and focused mode==** helps us to learn in different ways
* **learning** something difficult **takes time** and **needs ==alternating== between ==states==**

## What is learning
***
*Different areas of brain activity - left active state, right resting state.*

+ **Brain connections are dynamic.** Even when a brain matures it stays dynamic.

## Procrastination, Memory and Sleep
When we don't want to work on something, we activate an **area of pain** in our brains. And the **brain looks for a way to stop** it. By **switching** to something else.

When you **start working on it**, then this negative stimulus/**pain disappears**.

+ The **==Pomodoro==** - just a little **timer** to **25'**, **turn off interruption** and focus.
+ Give some **small reward afterwards** - mental relaxation

## Practice make permanent
+ **Math** is more difficult because of its **abstract nature** - opposite example the word COW can be related to real subject, even the word sounds like an animal sound. Concepts like LOVE are a little more abstract but can be connected with emotions. For math, such connections are not obvious.
+ **the more ==abstract== the more important is ==regular practice==**. This **brings** the concept **to** our **reality**
+ practicing **deepens** the **neuronal connections** and builds patterns in our brain

*Patterns getting strong the more we practice, visualized by the different color intensity in the Pinball analogy*

***

* So **study something** a little more intense, **then walk away and let it simmer** in diffuse more for a while

## Long term memory and working memory
### Working memory
* What I immediately and consciously process in my mind.
* Can hold about **==4 chunks of information==**
* **Need to repeat often** to hold something in working memory

### Long term memory
* Like a storage warehouse, where I store fundamental concepts I'm learning about
* **Need to revisit often** in order to store something more permanent
* recommended to **work with ==spaced repetition**==. Provided **time for synaptic connections** to form.

This is mainly where [[MOC Building a 2nd brain]] comes in handy.

## The importance of sleep
+ Sleep **removes toxic elements** from the brain. Brain cells shrink and provide space for fluids to flow better and wash out toxic waste.
+ one needs to have **good sleep before an exam**
+ important aspect of memory and learning process. Sleep erases less important parts and strengthens things to remember.
+ **increases understanding of difficult problems** - as other parts of our brain start to communicate 
+ **learning short before sleeping** increases change of dreaming about it

## Interview with Dr. Terrence Sejnowski about his way of learning
Leading scientist in the world of topic neuroscience.
+ get into the thick of it, **get involved in experiment and learn by doing**, together with experts
+ interrupt boring lectures by asking a question ... and provide space for a discussion
+ learn a lot more **by active engaging** rather than passive listening
+ **take a walk to get into diffuse mode**
	+ have a little notebook along to take immediate notes with the new ideas
+ **multitasking ability is to switch from one topic to another** (faster) [^1]
+ if you **==put someone in an environment where this person can flourish==** ... neuron connection becomes much stronger (he and a colleague discovered that!)
	+ having an enriched environment is helping a lot
	+ in absence also exercise will help 
+ Claim: It needs physical activity and sports to strengthen neuronal connections
+ **talk to someone and explain a concept** ... boosts the creative process
+ **success** does not automatically come from being smart ... but often **from being passionate and persistent**

### Staying creative
+ with **surrounding with youth and strong drive for learning**

### Tests
* don't hung up .. move on and come back to it later

## Interview with Daphne Gray Grant
[publicationcoach.com](publicationcoach.com)

+ **diffuse mode is used for writing**, being in the writing mode
+ **focussed mode for editing**
+ use **==mindmapping==** ([[Mindmapping by Daphne]])
	+ l**iberates brain** .. you can go off in every direction 
	+ work with an unlimitted canvas (like excalidraw)
	+ write down what occurs to your brain
	+ can be also use **==for recapturing an interview==** ... just put notes aside and create mindmap based on your memory
	+ helps to extract the key-insights from our memory
+ ==**do not outline before writing**== - as this engaged the focussed brain
+ memorization helps to understand the underlying reason much more deeply (would be interesting to compare that with writing extensive notes like with a Second Brain ... where I passively likely memorize but also invest in ROA optimzation)
+ **==Mistake Nr 1: Editing while you write (is like cleaning the table while reading)==**
	+ hang a towel over the monitor ... I use the Obsidian line focus plugin for that
	+ writeordie.com ... screen starts to pinken when you stopped writing, later a loud noise
+ Talk back to your inner critics voice and mention that you are not in writing mode and will come to editing later
