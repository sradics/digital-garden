+ humans don't make communication, but¬†instead, **we ARE communication**
+ The purpose of human communication is to to try to **connect with or tune into other people**,¬†but with a concrete **purpose**, that of **reaching agreements** that will allow us **to solve problems¬†or conflicts** that arise in any relationship, so we can reach agreements, precisely, and that they may be productive
+ first step to being an effective communicator is to **identify¬†on what level of communication we are transmitting our thoughts and feelings**
	+ 1 - **neutral level** - trivialities and clich√©s; that is, topics that don't affect us and don't commit us ... wheater
	+ 2 - **external level** - points of view and opinions
	+ 3 - **internal level** - emotions & feelings
	+ 4 - **intimate level** - express deep ideas and feelings, sharing values and secrets
+ humans are unique because we¬†**pursue objectives**¬†through communication or to establish agreements that are mutually beneficial.
+ ‚Äúcomunicare,‚Äù to make something common - find¬†**points in common**
