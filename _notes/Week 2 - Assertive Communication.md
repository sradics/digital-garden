# Week 2 - Assertive Communication
+  **‚Äúassertive‚Äù** means to compel, **to go directly**
+ communicate with **messages that are delivered clearly, firmly, directly, and respectfully**
+ the **success of assertive communication** largely **depends** on how the **recipient perceives the message**. It's crucial to **analyze the situation** and the recipient before conveying the message, understanding that there are degrees to assertiveness.
+ strategize how the message is conveyed, **considering not just the content but also emotions, desired outcomes, and potential consequences**
+ Open aggression can elicit responses of aggression or evasion, while passive aggression, characterized by sarcasm and ambiguity, can confuse recipients.
+ it is important to **consider who we are directing our message to**, before sending it
	+ evaluate their way of being, their previous responses to our communication and, in general, all the sociocultural conditioning of the person


sensitive to the feelings of the other person, a quality called¬†**empathy**.

The communicative leader is able to direct, teach, guide, motivate, and solve problems continuously.
Assertive leaders feel free to express themselves just as they are. Their words and actions confirm: this is who I am and this is how I feel, think, and what I want

### Benefits of assertive communication
+ promotes **quality and respect**
+ promotes **collaboration**

### Questions for my communication strategy
- What does the other person need?
- What does he or she need from me?
- How do I feel about this situation? How do I feel about this?
- How could the other person think and feel about this?
- What communication channel is most appropriate: e-mail, phone call, personal dialogue, voice message, or electronic message?




### DESC - Describe - Express - Specify - Consequences
Key components of assertive messaging include *Describing*, *Expressing*, *Suggesting alternatives*, *Consequences*.
#### D - stands for Describing the situation clearly
 **Description**: Clearly focus on the **specific event.** For example, rather than saying "this report is poorly done," specify exactly what the issue is, such as an error in a sales column in a report. This precision helps avoid generalities and potential misunderstandings.

#### E - is for Expressing feelings about the situation
**Expression of Emotions**: Express how you feel or think about the situation, which can release stress and provide weight to the message. Phrases like "I'm worried about this situation" can be effective.

It is emotionally freeing to express our feelings, avoiding the extremes of repression or toxic, negative manifestations of emotions.


#### S - is for Suggesting alternatives or solutions
**Request for Action**: After detailing the problem and expressing feelings, suggest solutions or ask the person for their input.

#### C - refers to detailing the Consequences of the issue
**Consequences**: Discuss the potential impact of the situation on individuals, teams, or the company.


The **first step in delivering an assertive message is to identify the situation or the condition** that we want to refer to, and express it as clearly and precisely as possible.
