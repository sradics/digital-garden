## Step 2: Create your Daily Energy Graph

## Step 3: Set aside highly energised time for $10K Work
+ look through the $10K tasks that you've identified.

## Step 4: use the $10K Framework and your Daily Energy Graph together
When planning out your day or wondering what to do next, go back to your Daily Energy Graph. Your peaks are reserved for $10K and $1.000 Work. And once you've reached rock bottom of your energy, it's time to hit a few $10 tasks out of the park.
