# Week 3 - Assignment

Focus on one of the key techniques to train our introspection muscle: Journaling

## Step 1: Set aside 5 - 25 minutes of uninterrupted time

## Step 2: Pick a prompt to journal on

- What's my motivation behind the last tool that I've bought?
- Where am I in three years if I continue doing what I'm currently doing?
- If I could live more consciously tomorrow, what changes would I make
- What is stopping me from changing things right now?
- What makes my day happy and bright?
- Where have I felt resistance during the last week?
- Who got my best energy?

> [!hint]
> Just as with meditation, it's more the process of sitting down with your own thoughts that's important than any sort of immediately tangible thing that might result from it.
