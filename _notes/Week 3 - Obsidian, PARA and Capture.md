Their knowledge is scattered  
  
â†’ Yours can be organized (too)  
  
Week 3 of our Learning Ecosystem Mastery Program kicked off yesterday with the question:  
  
"How can we transform scattered information into accessible knowledge that serves our thinking?"  
  
In our session we focused on:  
  
â†’ A 30-minute Obsidian walkthrough  
Obsidian has a learning curve,  
but seeing and experimenting starts the journey.  
  
Seeing and live experimenting starts the journey.  
  
â†’ Implementing PARA (Projects-Areas-Resources-Archives)  
A simple framework for "where does this go?"  
  
Participants explored their Obsidian Vault where PARA is already tangible.  
  
â†’ Quick capture with Spark-Remark-Relate  
A simple, yet powerful practice for daily use.  
  
We went from "I don't know where to put this" to  
an idea how to organize our information.  
  
All participants now have access to the Second Brain AI assistant I described yesterday  
([https://lnkd.in/eadR_cxq](https://lnkd.in/eadR_cxq)).  
  
It was a dense session with great questions, some struggles, and many impulses for next steps. Exploration hour follows on Thursday.  

What's your biggest challenge with organizing your (digital) information?
