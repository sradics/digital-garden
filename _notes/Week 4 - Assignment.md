## Step 1: Brainstorm skills adjacent to your existing skillset

[A huge list of Adjacent Skills](https://matthiasfrank.notion.site/Adjacent-Skills-2db7a7a6cf6e49e1a9fa4a25d6c9e857)


## Step 2: Pick an Adjacent Skill

> [!tip]
> In the next year, I will learn *New Adjacent Skill* to complement my *existing skillset*. This will allow me to *leverage Existing Skill by* combining both skills

## Step 3: Identify your path to this new skill
+ Who in your network already has this skill? Could they help you learn it?
+ How will you track/measure your progress?
+ Can you compile a list of resources to help?
+ Could you hire someone to help?
