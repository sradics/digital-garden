## Step 2: Pick an Adjacent Skill

> [!tip]
> In the next year, I will learn *New Adjacent Skill* to complement my *existing skillset*. This will allow me to *leverage Existing Skill by* combining both skills

## Step 3: Identify your path to this new skill
+ Who in your network already has this skill? Could they help you learn it?
+ How will you track/measure your progress?
+ Can you compile a list of resources to help?
+ Could you hire someone to help?
