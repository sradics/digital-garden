# Week 4 - Course Notes - How to become a better learner
Course: [Learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) by Dr. Barbara Oakley, Dr. Terrence Sejnowski
Course claim: **Learn more effectively and with less frustration**
**Week 4: How to become a better learner**

## How to become a better learner
+ best gift is **physical exercise**
	+ exercise/sports helps new neurons to survive (as practicing does too)
+ when the brain is prepared, practice is perfect
	+ book: [[Fixing my Gaze - Susan R Barry]] - fix how we see in 3 dimensions

## Renaissance Learning
+ Learn **using metaphors and analogy**
+ Work profitably with teammates

There are times of restructuring the understanding, that might feel like hitting the wall during learning. One needs to sustain that period. Afterwards our knowledge base will take a surprising leap forward.

### Create a lively visual metaphor or analogy
**==Metaphor==** - e.g. visualize electrical currency as flowing water through a pipe. **See something in your minds eyes.**

***
*Example of a metaphor for electrical currency*

***

Example: To memorize a Cation, think of a cat 🐈  - a cat that makes you positive. 
+ **==Analogy==** - discover similarities between 2 ideas.
+ **==Stories==** - help to easily retain what we learned
* people learn by trying to make sense out of the information thy perceive
+ deliberate practice on the toughest parts of your material can lift our brains a lot
## The imposter syndrome
The thinking of not being knowledgable enough to meaningfully contribute.

## Change your thoughts, change your life

> Perseverance - the virtue of the less brilliant. (*Ramon y Cajal*) 


**==How we think matters.==**
+ Look at a problem with your unique perspective (and don't just follow blindly a lecture)
+ Linking to [[Mindset]]
+ **remove from people that undercut your efforts** in learning and understanding

## The value of teamwork - avoiding overconfidence
It is important **to zoom out on a topic** and look at it from a **big picture perspective**. This then also involves the right brain hemisphere and provides the devil's advocate to question our thinking
To question status quo and look for global inconsistencies.

Deep in focus mode, we might make minor mistakes in assumptions/calculations. We need to catch that early on, to not build to much of new knowledge on top of that.

> The first principles is that you must not fool yourself - and you are the easiest person to fool. (*Richard Feynman*) 

+ **Brainstorm and with fellow persons/teammates/friends**, working on a similar topic - this **helps catch, what you missed**. Important for group work:
	+ **start sessions in time**
	+ **keep attention on the subject**
	+ **have preparation work done**

## A Test checklist to access if your test preparation is on target
*developed by Richard Felder*

+ testing is a powerful learning exercise
+ testing concentrates the mind

Aim to answer yes to the following questions:
+ Did I make a **serious effort to understand** the text?
+ Did I **work with classmates** on homework problems?
+ Did I attempt to **outline every homework problem solution**?
+ Did I **participate actively in homework group discussions**?
+ Did I **consult with the instructor**?
+ Did I **understand all the homework solutions** (when provided)?
	+ Did I **ask for explanations** of problem solutions that weren't clear to me?
+ Did I **run through the study guide**?
+ Did I **attempt to outline lots of problem solutions quickly**?
+ Did I **go over the study guide and problems with classmates** and quiz one another?
+ Did I **attend the review** session?
+ Did I **get a reasonable night's sleep** before the test?

## Strategies for taking tests
### Hard Start - jump to easy
Don't start with the easy to solve problems first. Instead **==start with the tough ones and quickly jump to the easy one==**.

So, pull yourself from the tough ones **within 1-2 minutes when you got stuck**.
Load your brain in short focus mode. Then you switch away from it and the problem goes to be processed in diffused mode.

It ensures also that one gets a little work done on several topics. And it avoids getting stuck on the wrong approach. By switching one gets the chance to look at the problem from different perspectives.

### Stress - The story you tell yourself about a test makes the difference
It's how you interpret a situation and the story you tell yourself about why you are stressed that makes the difference.

+ Rewire: **This test has made me excited.**
+ Take **deep breaths**.
+ **Face your fears!** And have a **plan B**
+ Multiple choice - cover up/hide answers and first try and recall the answers from your brain
+ Don't push the brain too hard with learning the day before the test
+ Take **big picture perspective** to check your answers

## Interviews
### Interview with Dr. Richard Felder and Dr. Rebecca Brent - How  to take a test (and how not too)
+ Instead of reading material like a novel, also your homework, one needs to **==work the problems==**. Pick out adjacent problems and work it. Don't waste time on the easy stuff (e.g. doing the simple algebra, once you found the solution already)
+ Work in a **study group**

#### Learning something new
+ **Big picture skim** through a topic, start to make sense of it
+ Learn by **==doing==** it:
	+ Read
	+ Explain
	+ Use 
	+ Teach with examples and clear explanations
+ Work in groups and figure something out together
+ **Use all the resources available** and dare to ask questions

#### Imposter syndrome and dealing with procrastination
+ many have imposter feeling often - the power is in naming it
+ **work with yourself** - I've mastered challenges before
+ **make tasks less overwhelming** & get it started
+ break a topic up in **small pieces**
+ **set easy targets** for yourself & make appointments with yourself
	+ linking to [PARI](https://melanie-almeida.com/en/the-pari-system-by-anne-laure-le-cunff-ness-labs/)
+ add some form of **accountability** e.g. with a friend

### Writer John Maquire - Putting objects in your writing
[Source](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/the-secret-to-good-writing-its-about-objects-not-ideas/263113/)

Deep dive: [readablewriting.com](readablewriting.com) - the Readability Method
+ think about object more than writing about ideas
+ what objects can I use to express my ideas
+ idea words end with -ion and -tion 
	+ make things abstract and blurry
	+ What is being said?
+ use the **ladder of abstractions**
	+ **ideas are highly abstract, objects/things are lowest abstract**
	+ e.g. nutrition is an abstract idea. vs. apple, bread are concrete things
+ make sure to write with enough things/objects
+ Chose a good style. Decide **what words** you gonna work with.
+ put in **active verbs** - verbs that make something happen on the page
+ **put in people**, by naming them
+ use **short words** instead of long
+ use **short sentences** instead of long
+ favor the **plain style**, make it clear and simple - **==clarity first==**
+ **separate the writing from the editing**
	+ writing is about getting things down rapidly
	+ editing is about taking decisions
+ recommendation to **edit on paper** (maybe Remarkable?)
+ **read closely the people you admire**
	+ what **openings** are used
	+ **underline words** to consider
	+ **study sentence length** (when short or long)
	+ what are **outstanding sentences**
+ **What am I trying to say?**
+ **What must I not leave out?**
+ Book: College writing guide

#### Writers and switching between focussed and diffused mode
+ diffused - talk about a writing with your fiends
+ diffused - do some reading, look up material
+ writing in sitting and standing positions
+ take a walk/sleep
