## Highlights
* I picked up another book to read on the side: ==The Bullet Journal Method== (affiliate link) by Ryder Carroll.
* On the surface, BuJo looks like a particular format for journaling and taking notes in a paper journal. But once you dive beneath the surface, it is actually ==a holistic methodology for taking action, clarifying your values, and focusing your attention on what matters most== (that just happens to be manifested in a paper journal).
