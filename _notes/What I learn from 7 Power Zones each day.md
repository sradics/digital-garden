What I learn from 7 PowerZones each day
()

Peloton Power Zones are output rangesâ€” a measurement of how hard youâ€™re working at any given point during a ride.

It is based on Functional Threshold Power - FTP - the level of exercise I can sustain for maximum one hour.

I love the body mind connection and how PowerZone training helps me to strengthen my willpower, helps me to think through topics but also to reach a body flow state where I can switch of thinking. 

Here's how each of the 7 Zones contributes to your mental and physical strength:

Zone 1 - WarmUp and Recovery, <55% FTP
The Zone to be in after an intense workout and for warmup up before a workout. 

Translated to work: Reminds me to take breaks after intense work. And to ease into intense sessions with meditation and focus work.

Zone 2 - Moderate, Conversational Intensity, 56-75% FTP
Where I get into flow and I can hold that for 2 hours well. Here my diffused mode of learning works best. 

Zone 3 - Sustainable, Conversation difficult, 76-90% FTP
Brings me to slight competition mode with myself. Opens up my mind and activates my body really well.  

Zone 4 - Challenging, max one hour, FTP, 91-105% FTP
Translation to work: Intense workshops, Heavy concentration Zone.
In this Zone I often think about challenging situations. It helps me to power through.

Zone 5 - Hard, 10-15 min max, 106-120% FTP
Here I get out of my comfort zone. At the same time, not much think, more focus on my body.  Provides peace of mind and stops the heave cognitive load.

Zone 6 - Very Hard, sustainable for 30 second 3-5 min max, 121-150% FTP
An intense area. Fully out of my comfort zone. But showing me how much I can do. No thinking, just pushing through. And provides adrenaline and feeling of being proud.

Zone 7 - Max effort, sustainable for a few seconds, >150% FTP
Super intense zone. Taps the limits. And I feel proud to have energized my willpower. I can't say that I really like this Zone ðŸ˜‰
