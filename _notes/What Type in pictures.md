My Learning Style demanded discomfort.  
  
â†’ I gained 5,500 followers  
  
9 months ago,  
my Learning Style analysis gave me these stretching exercises:  
  
â†’ Act without perfect plans  
â†’ Connect with strangers  
â†’ Share struggles openly  
â†’ Embrace chaos  
â†’ Trust instincts  
â†’ Inspire others  
  
The results?  
  
â€”â€”â€” AD BREAK - SKIP! Reverse psychology appliedâ€”â€”â€”

â€”â€”â€” END OF AD â€”â€”â€” (did you skip successfully?)  
  
â†’ From 2,500 to 8,000 followers  
(by connecting with new people daily)  
  
â†’ Get into action and build the plane while flying  
(perfect plans are overrated)  
  
â†’ Share my struggles and questions with you  
(remember the Kingdomino downfall?)  
  
â†’ Don't ask about chaos. PleAsE.  
(Order is so 90's)  
  
â†’ Followed gut feelings  
(Like switching house locations mid-construction. Yes, really!)  
  
And maybe, just maybe, inspired some of you along the way.  

All this growth?  
Started with understanding my Learning Style.
