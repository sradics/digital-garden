# [[What a lifelong reading list]]

## LinkedIn Post

[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_i-sat-on-53000-unused-book-highlights-activity-7219219314942316545-LOaj?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

I sat on 53000 unused book highlights ðŸ¤¯

â†’ I read 238 books on Kindle alone
â†’ ChatGPT helped me to analyse all
â†’ I took 53108! highlights, avg 223/ðŸ“–

That is a crazy amount of knowledge, isn't it?

â†’ For a long time I did not even realize
â†’ That I'm sitting on this treasure
â†’ Once read, I forgot most of it 
â†’ Lost about 90% within days

Does that really make sense?

â†’ To invest lifetime in reading 
â†’ For me about 8-10h/book
â†’ Just to forget about it

What if I told you, there is a better way?

â†’ Where you keep strong insights
â†’ Available at your fingertips 
â†’ Ready to apply fast

âž  Doable with a small extra effort.

Interesting, right? 
This is my approach now:

â†’ Obsidian stores my knowledge in one place
â†’ I continue with highlighting while reading
â†’ And connected Kindle with Obsidian
â†’ Highlights imported automatically

Now I can:

â†’ Search through all highlights of all books
â†’ Ask AI to provide me a meta summary 
â†’ Connect book insights and thoughts
â†’ Add my extra thinking to it

And:
âž  Build on top of it 
â†’ Compounding knowledge
â†’ Expressed for example in Daily Writing
Does that sound interesting?

â†’ This solution iâ†’ Install - Connect - Sync - Use âœ…
â†’ 15' invest now âž  Learn smart
â†’ DM SMART and I suppo
