What a nerdy day this was...  
  
â†’ I caught a Python  
  
Remember how I rescued 400 book highlights without endless typing?  
(Refresher:  
[https://lnkd.in/gcazRwqk](https://lnkd.in/gcazRwqk)))  
  
Yesterday, I received an unexpected call.  
The voice was rusty, but filled with passion.  
Who was this mysterious developer?  
And why did they reach out to me?  
  
I listened, intrigued.  
  
Hours later, the mystery unraveled:  
â†’ A Python was caught  
  
This Python-Script does something magical:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ Scans 141 images of my paper-book highlights  
â†’ Extracts text from each highlight  
â†’ Consolidates all into one comprehensive note  
  
The result?  
â†’ 300 pages distilled to core insights  
â†’ Processing time cut from 4-8 hours to just 1 hour per book  
â†’ A foundation for evolving AI capabilities  
  
(I'll share a link to the overview in the comments)  
  
Appreciations:  
â€”â€”â€”  
â†’ To my inner voice (the mysterious caller): Thanks for the dev push  
â†’ Google Gemini API: You rock!  
â†’ AI-assisted coding: This is the future, and it's thrilling  
  
Is it perfect? Not yet.  
But it's a giant leap for my learning process.  
  
Curious about the Python?  
â†’ DM or comment "PythonCatcher" for the script
