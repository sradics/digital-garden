I tried this impactful reading approach

â†’ I had to stop after 5 hours
â†’ I was so immersed but had to decide
â†’ Otherwise, I would ruin my sleep routine

I donâ€™t know if you find a book 
or if a book finds you. 
Yesterday ðŸ“– Limitless found me!
I think ðŸ˜®

I (still) struggle with my speed of reading!
I admire people that can read super fast.
And Jim Kwik shares in ðŸ“– Limitless
To apply Pomodoro to reading.
Read for 25 minutes intense!
Then take a 5 minute break
Drink water, relax, review
Do the next 25/5 cycle.

I tried that yesterday with 6 cycles. 
I adhered to the approach.
With a longer break after 3 cycles.

â€”â€”â€” First impressions

I was able to focus much better.
The reviews after 25' help with zooming out.
âž  I'm at 1/3 of the book already. 
âž  Curious on the speed reading hints to come

Sunday ... Reading time? 
Have fun experimenting with a Pomodoro!

What do YOU read at the moment?
