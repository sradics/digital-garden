I said 'this is absolutely crazy' out loud.  
  
â†’ Three moments from this AI-filled week  
  
(1)  
â†’ I joined the Google Agent builder course  
I'm sitting in the Google Agent builder session, laptop open, following along as the instructor walks us through the interface. The screen shows this clean, simple prompt box - nothing fancy, just a text field waiting for input.  
  
I'm thinking, "Alright, let's see what this can actually do," as I start typing my first prompt. The instructor said to get our hands dirty, so I hit enter and...  
  
Boom. The entire agent code starts generating in real-time. Line after line of complex code flowing down the screen. My eyes widen and I lean forward, watching this thing build itself. I'm thinking, "Wait, this system is creating the complete agent code in the background? They're connected to 200 LLMs? This is absolutely crazy."  
  
I feel my heart rate pick up - that mix of excitement and overwhelm when you realize you're witnessing another massive transition. My hands are gripping the laptop edges as I watch the code compile.  
  
I catch myself saying out loud, "I need to dive deeper here."

(2)  
â†’ I joined The Dock - Langdock's AI forum  
I click into The Dock forum and see '100+ members.' Scrolling down, familiar names jump out at me. I'm thinking, 'This isn't just a forum - it's a reunion of AI builders. So great to be here.'  
  
here is my brief summary: [https://lnkd.in/e2_a-76E](https://lnkd.in/e2_a-76E)  
  
(3)  
â†’ We're in week 7 of the Learning Ecosystem program, focused on AI assistants. I'm watching participants struggle with the basics and thinking, "I could make this so much easier for them." I got inspired from Peter - I'll build a Meta AI assistant builder.

It's moving super fast.  
It needs a system for keeping pace.  
  
Happy to use one. Happy to share one.
