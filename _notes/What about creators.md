# [[What about creators ]]

## LinkedIn Post

[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_stuck-ideas-driving-you-crazy-let-me-show-activity-7346050062893871104-Nr91?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAA1M1pkBgWCYPhT45EpfLiHzViQqRWNCIv4)

I was shocked by what I didn't hear.  
  
â†’ At a Creator Summit filled with growth hackers and platform experts  
  
The conversation was all about trends and tactics, but the AI fluency was surprisingly low.  
  
Many creators hadn't even built a simple AI assistant. (Something like a GPT, Gem, or Claude Project)  
  
In 2025? Really?  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
Here's what I realized:  
  
Most creators are trapped by what I call  
the "Four Horsemen of Creator Attrition":  
  
â†’ Platform Dependency  
You're constantly at the mercy of algorithms you don't control.  
  
â†’ Monetization Volatility  
Your income can vanish overnight without warning.  
  
â†’ Content Fatigue  
Stuck on the "ideation treadmill" with endless pressure to produce. This kills creativity and joy.  
  
â†’ The Solopreneurship trap  
Drowning in admin workâ€”marketing, accounting, strategyâ€”with no time for actual creating.  
  
Sound familiar?  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
There's a different path: becoming a Symbiotic Creator.  
You build a powerful, personalized ecosystem with AI thinking partners.  
  
Imagine this:  
  
â†’ Never staring at a blank page because you have a compounding library of your best ideas  
  
â†’ Turning fleeting thoughts into valuable intellectual property  
(think of courses, books, workshops)  
  
â†’ Automating 80% of grunt workâ€”research, sorting, summarizingâ€”so you focus on what only you can do  
  
â†’ Developing your unique voice because your AI partner finds novel connections within YOUR curated knowledge, not generic web content  
  
You shift from Content Producer to Knowledge Entrepreneur.  
  
Tomorrow 9AM CEST, I'm showing the Idea Explorer AI assistant live:  
[https://lnkd.in/eZXMER52](https://lnkd.in/eZXMER52)  
  
You'll see:  
â†’ The complete build process I used to create this AI assistant  
â†’ How AI becomes your creative thinking partner (not replacement)  
â†’ Real-time idea development with my creativity coach  
  
Ready to explore your AI potential?
