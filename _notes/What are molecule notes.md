# What are molecule notes

Bigger entities that combine multiple notes and form a note sequence that all belong to one bigger idea/thought.

Can be all inside one big note, with different paragraphs. 

Or can be with links to separate notes, each providing deeper insights on an important aspect of a thought. Then likely we will create a hub here, to provide an entry point to the thought. 

Tracing a chain of arguments (not sequences).
All building to the argument. Creating a chain of reasoning. 

Explain the relationships too (and not just link).
Idea: ðŸ’¡ - think about link descriptions too 
- Where should they life?
- What might be the main value for it?
- S-R-R --- it would provide more meaning to the relate
- 

This is an example of deeper linking already while writing
