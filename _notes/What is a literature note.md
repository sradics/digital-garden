# _What is a literature note
[Source](https://fortelabs.co/blog/how-to-take-smart-notes/)
The second type of note is known as a “literature note.” As he read, Luhmann would write down on index cards the main points he didn’t want to forget or that he thought he could use in his own writing, with the bibliographic details on the back. 

Ahrens offers four guidelines in creating literature notes:

1.  Be extremely selective in what you decide to keep
2.  Keep the overall note as short as possible
3.  Use your own words, instead of copying quotes verbatim
4.  Write down the bibliographic details on the source
