## LinkedIn Post

[Post at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_something-felt-off-really-off-yesterdays-activity-7364533206018072576-yi12?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAA1M1pkBgWCYPhT45EpfLiHzViQqRWNCIv4)

Something felt off. Really off.

â†’ Yesterday's Vibe Coding session revealed something I can't decode

I invited my community to a free knowledge-sharing session.

Topic: Vibe Coding - building tiny apps without the complexity.

The prep work: 
â†’ Multiple posts explaining the concept 
â†’ Dedicated newsletter with details  
â†’ Several event reminders on LinkedIn

Result: 2 amazing participants joined.

â€”â€”â€”

Here's what's puzzling me:

11k followers. Often strong engagement. Free valuable session.

Yet minimal attendance.

â€”â€”â€”

I'm genuinely curious about your perspective:

â†’ Do I need to push harder to cut through the noise? 
â†’ Is my message too unclear about the value? 
â†’ Should I price sessions at â‚¬500 to signal seriousness?

I'm clearly missing something in how I communicate these opportunities.

â€”â€”â€”

I'm genuinely stuck on this one.

Your thoughts could be the missing piece I need.

Comment below, DM me, or let's hop on a call if you've cracked this puzzle.

P.S. Recording from "Don't Code Hard, Code Happy - Lessons about Vibe Coding" drops soon.
