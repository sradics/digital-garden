# What makes content sticky?
[source](https://growth.design/case-studies/tiktok-feed-psychology)

1.Â **Simple**Â (very short and basic)  
2.Â **Unexpected**Â (curiosity gap)  
3.Â **Concrete**Â (e.g. relevant to COVID19)  
4.Â **Emotional**Â (fun/fear, music-driven)  
5.Â **Story**Â (e.g. woman looking for a mask)

Science shows that those are 5 of the key elements to make an idea stick.1
