# What makes content sticky?
[source](https://growth.design/case-studies/tiktok-feed-psychology)

1. **Simple** (very short and basic)  
2. **Unexpected** (curiosity gap)  
3. **Concrete** (e.g. relevant to COVID19)  
4. **Emotional** (fun/fear, music-driven)  
5. **Story** (e.g. woman looking for a mask)

Science shows that those are 5 of the key elements to make an idea stick.1
