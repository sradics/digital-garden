When I cook, I like to improvise.  
  
â†’ The secret to mastery isn't always improvisation.  
â†’ Sometimes, it's in the recipe.  

Improvisation works well for my everyday meals.  
â†’ Where I know what to do  
â†’ Where following an exact plan doesn't matter that much.  
  
Improvisation does not work for baking.  
â†’ Where it's important to follow an exact order.  
â†’ Where I need to use the right amount of ingredients.  
  
I've learned it several times.  
I've ruined a cake too often.  
  
Sometimes, it's just important to follow the rules.  
  
At least in the beginning.  
  
Until we learn where and when we can add our own flavor.  
  
This reminds me of SHU-HA-RI,  
a Japanese learning concept describing three stages of mastering a skill.  

In SHU â†’ you follow the rule  
â€”â€”â€”  
By copying techniques exactly as described.  
  
That is my level when is comes to baking.  

In HA â†’ you break the rule  
â€”â€”â€”  
â‡¢ You explore and understand the principles.  
â‡¢ You question approaches.  
â‡¢ You start to improvise.  
  
That is my level when it comes to LinkedIn writing  
  
In RI â†’ you become the rule  
â€”â€”â€”  
Where you develop your own approach based on your deep understanding.  
  
That is how I blend approaches for better learning.  
  
I can guide you through SHU-HA-RI,  
when it comes to learning with smarter approaches.  
  
I help people learn how to learn, retain, and recall with ease
