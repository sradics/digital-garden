## Highlights
* And by tilting the balance ever further in the direction of “safety”, they forget about what should be on the other side of the scale, which is **“making the most of your finite time on this lovely planet.”**
* According to **The 4% Rule**, Alina’s nest egg will provide a pretty reliable income of roughly $80,000 per year for the rest of her life. Or to put it another way, her planned spending of $50k is only a 2.5% withdrawal rate from that 2 million. Since 4% is reasonably safe, 2.5% is a preposterously safe withdrawal rate.
* But this rule is incorrect. It is indeed possible to be “too safe”, because **safety comes at a high cost – and the price is your own life**.
* **If you quit your job right now, what would a good, typical, and improbably bad scenario look like for your financial future?** * 
	* Then in the case of the “bad” scenario, write down, step by step, what it would really mean for you to run out of money.
