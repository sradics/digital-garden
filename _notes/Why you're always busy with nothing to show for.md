## Highlights
* **what’s really happening is meta-work. Low-value you work that doesn’t move you any closer to your goals.**
* But with **meta-work, you’re in the land of $100 Work**. Yes, it’s much better to read books about parenting than to watch Logan Paul reels
	* it’s still a distraction. It’s not moving you closer to your goals, dreams and desired life.
* Behind the distraction? 
* Are you burnt out? 
* Are you confused about a project’s next action? 
* Are you scared of failing? 
* Or being judged? 
* Are you unclear about your goals? 
* Do you actually know what makes you happy?
