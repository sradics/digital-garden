## Highlights

* **whatâ€™s really happening is meta-work. Low-value you work that doesnâ€™t move you any closer to your goals.**
* But with **meta-work, youâ€™re in the land of $100 Work**. Yes, itâ€™s much better to read books about parenting than to watch Logan Paul reels
	* itâ€™s still a distraction. Itâ€™s not moving you closer to your goals, dreams and desired life.
* Behind the distraction? 
* Are you burnt out? 
* Are you confused about a projectâ€™s next action? 
* Are you scared of failing? 
* Or being judged? 
* Are you unclear about your goals? 
* Do you actually know what makes you happy?
