## Content preparation

I'm designing our group coaching sessions. And for each session I fully immerse in the topic, I read a lot, interview people and think about best ways to connect content and exercises in a way that attendees have an exceptional experience and leave sessions with a concrete impulse to apply the learnings right away. 

Recently I co-created our Women in Leadership Group Coaching with Katharina. And I deeply connected to how grateful I am to have worked and work with so many great Women in very different leadership dimensions. I'd like to take the time today to thank you for being great role models, for your inspiration, your passion and many great moments.
