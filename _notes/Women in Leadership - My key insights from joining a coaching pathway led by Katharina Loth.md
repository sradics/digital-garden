# [[Women in Leadership - My key insights from joining a coaching pathway led by Katharina Loth ]]

From December 2022 until February 2023 I joined the Coaching Pathway ==Women in Leadership== conducted by [Katharina Loth]() featured by Blinkist.

## Brief overview on the pathway

The coaching pathway consists of 3 main learning modules, surrounded by a Kick-Off and a session to Wrap up the course. It was organized as a cohort based format combined with preparations for each module.

+ Module 1 focussed on *Confidence* and *Gender Bias*
+ Module 2 focussed on *Lean Out*
+ Module 3 ❔

## Topic of Confidence

> [!important] Key Insight
> Confidence is the bridge between thoughts and actions. In addition to competence it needs confidence to get the job done.

Confidence can be increased. For instance by working with our fears. When we get conscious about our fears we can actively welcome them to help us getting into action. 

> [!question]
> What did you not put into action and what held you back?

Reflecting with that question in mind helps to surface blockers and fears that undermine our confidence. 

> [!question]
> What do I want to put into action? 

This question helps to gain clarity. Explicitly stating it and combining it with an understanding what is holding me back, provides concrete building blocks for my confidence bridge.

> [!important] Key Insight
> Be wise in picking people who can cheer me up. Provide special attention to how much I can rely on their mutual support.

In addition to relying on others, I can become my own cheerleader and grow my own brand. By being loud about my areas of expertise.

> [!question]
> How confident do I feel in my role from 1..10? 

> [!question]
> How confident (1..10) with my role would I like to be in 6 months?

> [!question]
> What behaviors do I need to show that demonstrate confidence AND the get me noticed?

In [[Module 1 - The confidence code]] I took notes from the Book in Blinks *The Confidence Code*.

I want to link that topic also to [[Mindset]] by Carol Dweck and [Osho - Being Brave]()
