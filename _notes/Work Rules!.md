It’s easy to run a team that does what they are told. But to have to explain to them why they’re doing something? And then debate whether it’s the right thing to do? What if they disagree with me?

We all want our work to matter. Nothing is a more powerful motivator than to know that you are making a difference in the world. — location: [587](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=587) ^ref-54744

If you believe people are good, you must be unafraid to share information with them — location: [605](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=605) ^ref-1973

“Default to open” is a phrase sometimes heard in the open-source technology community. — location: [607](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=607) ^ref-52619

Restricting information should be a conscious effort, and you’d better have a good reason for doing — location: [609](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=609) ^ref-36764

---
Large organizations often have groups doing redundant work without knowing it, wasting resources. — location: [637](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=637) ^ref-8017

---
Information sharing allows everyone to understand the differences in goals across different groups, avoiding internal rivalry. — location: [637](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=637) ^ref-29019

---
One of the serendipitous benefits of transparency is that simply by sharing data, performance improves. — location: [654](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=654) ^ref-5624

---
Every meeting is recorded and made available to all employees. Bridgewater’s founder, Ray Dalio, explains: — location: [660](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=660) ^ref-1252

A more subtle objective is to reduce politicking. It’s hard to go behind someone’s back when they can later listen to your meetings. — location: [666](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=666) ^ref-62934

stark lesson in the importance of having a direct conversation with my colleagues! — location: [678](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=678) ^ref-58321

---
Fundamentally, if you’re an organization that says “Our people are our greatest asset” (as most do), and you mean it, you must default to open. Otherwise, you’re lying to your people and to yourself. — location: [680](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=680) ^ref-13698

---
Voice means giving employees a real say in how the company is run. — location: [685](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=685) ^ref-58919

---
“Getting employees to voice ideas has long been recognized as a key driver of high-quality decisions and organizational effectiveness. Research on voice has shown positive effects of employees — location: [693](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=693) ^ref-31204

you give people freedom, they will amaze — location: [752](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=752) ^ref-6889

---
we consistently made decisions based not on economics, but on what supported our values. — location: [755](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=755) ^ref-10515

---
Our culture was shaping our strategy, and not the other way around. — location: [757](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=757) ^ref-44523

---
My personal and professional experience is that if you give people freedom, they will surprise, delight, and amaze you. They will also sometimes disappoint you, but if we were perfect we wouldn’t be human. This isn’t an indictment of freedom. It’s just one of the trade-offs. — location: [787](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=787) ^ref-52931

---
Why hiring is the single most important people activity in any organization — location: [795](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=795) ^ref-20411

---
The ostensible purpose is to obtain people who have demonstrated their capabilities by building great products and who otherwise would not join you as employees. — location: [830](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=830) ^ref-64495

---
acqui-hired employees generate better outcomes than hired employees. Some do, but I haven’t seen evidence that it’s generally true. — location: [838](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=838) ^ref-35342

---
For all these reasons, most organizations pursue the Bad News Bears strategy, though they don’t admit it. — location: [848](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=848) ^ref-42427

---
Second, if they were really better at recruiting, shouldn’t there be something special about how they recruit? — location: [853](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=853) ^ref-4020

---
But overall, the quality of their new hires is average. — location: [856](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=856) ^ref-3109

---
Third, most people simply aren’t very good at interviewing. — location: [857](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=857) ^ref-38118

---
We all think we are great at it, but we never go back to check if we are, and so we never get better. — location: [862](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=862) ^ref-12765

---
There’s ample data showing that most assessment occurs in the first three to five minutes of an interview (or even more quickly), — location: [862](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=862) ^ref-31348

---
Can’t you compensate by training people to be great? — location: [871](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=871) ^ref-36089

---
Designing effective training is hard. Really hard. — location: [873](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=873) ^ref-54166

---
Some experts go so far as to say that 90 percent of training doesn’t cause a sustained improvement in performance or change in behavior because it’s neither well designed nor well delivered. — location: [873](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=873) ^ref-58974

---
though most of those successes are a result of changing the context and type of work, rather than a benefit of training. — location: [877](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=877) ^ref-33535

---
Companies continue to invest substantially more in training than in hiring, according to the Corporate Executive Board. — location: [887](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=887) ^ref-47894

---
But since when is spending a measure of quality results? — location: [892](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=892) ^ref-18681

---
This means the majority of our time and money spent on people is invested in attracting, assessing, — location: [896](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=896) ^ref-26319

---
and cultivating new hires. — location: [896](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=896) ^ref-7129

---
we are better able to select people up front, that means we have less work to do with them once they are hired. — location: [897](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=897) ^ref-24039

---
The first change is to hire more slowly. Only 10 percent of your applicants (at best!) will be top performers, so you go through far more applicants and interviews. — location: [918](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=918) ^ref-7293

---
top-notch engineer is worth three hundred times or more than an average engineer. — location: [922](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=922) ^ref-15135

---
“Only hire people who are better than you.” — location: [952](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=952) ^ref-57889

---
you also need managers to give up power when it comes to hiring. — location: [959](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=959) ^ref-20069

---
But even the best-intentioned managers compromise their standards as searches drag on. — location: [960](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=960) ^ref-19053

---
We were still managing people issues based on our best instincts, which could be just as flawed as anyone else’s, instead of complementing them with data. — location: [971](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=971) ^ref-25439

---
the company and how you’ve distinguished yourself. — location: [976](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=976) ^ref-28891

---
You obviously want to hire the best people, but “best” isn’t defined by a single attribute like intelligence or expertise. — location: [985](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=985) ^ref-55120

---
making sure someone will thrive in your environment becomes critical. — location: [987](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=987) ^ref-47458

---
among the most important of which are humility and conscientiousness. — location: [989](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=989) ^ref-9059

---
“Don’t hire exclusively for smarts.” — location: [992](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=992) ^ref-29363

---
people who will be successful in the context of your organization, and who will make everyone around them more successful. — location: [994](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=994) ^ref-1981

---
which means we hire about 0.25 percent of the people we consider. — location: [1005](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1005) ^ref-20718

---
realized it was important to hire by committee, — location: [1015](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1015) ^ref-6560

---
They intuited that no individual interviewer will get it right every time, an instinct that would later be formalized in our “wisdom of the crowds” — location: [1016](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1016) ^ref-20550

---
hew to an objective standard, — location: [1019](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1019) ^ref-29880

---
And we have one final reviewer of every—yes, every—candidate: our CEO, Larry Page. — location: [1021](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1021) ^ref-12578

---
Each generation of hiring will therefore be a slightly poorer version of the hiring done by the prior generation. — location: [1026](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1026) ^ref-59405

---
These are almost always a compromise of quality. The result is that you go from hiring stellar people as a small company or team to hiring average people as a big company. — location: [1028](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1028) ^ref-31401

---
We required dozens of interviews, rejected more than 99 percent of candidates, and typically offered candidates lower pay than they were currently getting. — location: [1046](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1046) ^ref-9918

---
we gathered many perspectives on each candidate, in the belief that any single view might be skewed, but some of what we collected was irrelevant. — location: [1064](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1064) ^ref-19562

---
so we stopped requiring grades and transcripts except from recent graduates. — location: [1070](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1070) ^ref-35330

---
The absence of coordination across interviewers also meant we often forgot to ask about some specific attribute, so the candidate had to come back for yet more interviews. — location: [1072](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1072) ^ref-52628

---
Being hired by Google could take six months or longer, and a candidate could endure fifteen or even twenty-five interviews before getting an offer. — location: [1078](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1078) ^ref-43837

---
and you have 150 to 500 hours of employee time invested in every hire before even considering the time spent by recruiters, — location: [1081](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1081) ^ref-29262

---
Bad performers and political people have a toxic effect on an entire team and require substantial management time to coach or exit. — location: [1085](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1085) ^ref-19064

---
there are some employees you should get rid of, but the goal of recruitment should be to have no such employees!” — location: [1087](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1087) ^ref-25348

---
A referral bonus is an extrinsic motivator, meaning that it is motivation that comes from outside yourself. — location: [1123](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1123) ^ref-17483

---
No. We were just doing a really poor job of managing our referrals. — location: [1130](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1130) ^ref-19279

---
We also developed a white-glove service for referrals, where referred candidates get a call within forty-eight hours and the referring Googler is provided weekly updates on the status of their candidates. — location: [1135](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1135) ^ref-37898

---
For example, we asked Googlers whom they would recommend for specific roles: “Who is the best finance person you ever worked with?” “Who is the best developer in the Ruby programming language?” — location: [1146](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1146) ^ref-9228

---
We asked them to go methodically through all of their Google+, Facebook, and LinkedIn contacts, with recruiters on standby to follow up immediately with great candidates they suggested. — location: [1148](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1148) ^ref-44470

Breaking down a huge question (“Do you know anyone we should hire?”) into lots of small, manageable ones (“Do you know anyone who would be a good salesperson in New York?”) — location: [1149](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1149) ^ref-51399

---
Great-performing people are happy and being amply rewarded where they are today. — location: [1154](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1154) ^ref-49882

Now they’ve become an in-house recruiting firm, with the goal of seeking out and cultivating the best people on the planet. — location: [1157](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1157) ^ref-990

---
The result is that our in-house search firm finds more than half of our hires each year, at a cost far lower than using outside firms, with deeper insight into the market, and while providing candidates with a warmer, more intimate experience. — location: [1160](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1160) ^ref-58095

Once we generate a list, we review portions of it with Googlers who have — location: [1178](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1178) ^ref-10877

---
expertise in that area or may know those individuals. — location: [1179](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1179) ^ref-43489

---
And while there may not be an opportunity today, it’s always possible the candidate has a bad day a year later and remembers that great conversation they had with a Google recruiter. — location: [1182](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1182) ^ref-52863

---
With an applicant’s permission, we’re then able to stay in touch with people who have skills we don’t need today but may in the future, and reach out to them as our needs change. — location: [1192](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=1192) ^ref-64649

The first week was just listening to our breathing, the next was observing the thoughts that ran through our heads as we breathed, working up to paying attention to our current emotions and how they felt in our bodies. After a month, I asked my team if we should continue. They insisted that we did. They told me our meetings seemed more focused, more thoughtful, and less acrimonious. — location: [2918](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NLHJKBE&location=2918) ^ref-7786
