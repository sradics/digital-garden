Freedom at 3 AM?

â†’ How I turn my odd energy spikes into my superpower

Freedom is for me to work with my flow of energy and not against it. 

It is about your Energy-Life-Harmony:
â†’ Distributing my work along my energy bands
â†’ Getting up when I want to work on a topic
â†’ Take a break when I want. 

I observe that I have an energy boost early morning. 
Usually at about 5AM, 
today I even had a first interesting boost at 3AM. 

With my changing living situation, 
I can now follow these impulses as I wish. 
Freedom is that it is okay to start this early.

â†’ I have a LinkedIn workflow with 
intense, focused writing, commenting, and connecting,
usually between 5 AM and 9:30 AM.

â†’ The I need a break
Often, I take a walk to process my impressions. 

â†’ I have a next energy boost from 11:00 - 13:00.

â†’ Then I eat something and need a break afterward. 
This is usually time for a short power nap, 
sometimes extending to 45 minutes, 
depending on how tired I am.

â†’ The next energy boost comes from 14:30 to about 19:00. 
During this time, I mainly focus on detailed business work,
have calls, run workshops, and work on my materials.

â†’ Followed by Dinner and some relaxation phase.

â†’ A final energy track from about 20:30 - 22:00. Partially filled with US related sessions. 

Compared to my previous life as an employee, 
especially my onsite jobs, 
this is so much different.

â†’ Do I get more done? Absolutely!
â†’ Do I love this higher level of freedom? Absolutely!

Adapting to my natural energy patterns beats following a fixed work schedule.

To get started, I recommend creating your energy map.

â†’ Map your energy level for each hour of the day. 
â†’ Notice patterns and adjust your working slots matching your energy patterns.

What is your energy crunch-time during the day?
