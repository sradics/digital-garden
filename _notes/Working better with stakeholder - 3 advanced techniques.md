## Highlights
## 1. Make Them Your Partner
* What does **partnership** mean? It’s an **exchange of value**.
* You need to **figure out what they’re really optimizing for**.
	* Making their numbers? Pushing some big initiative? Protecting against a major threat?
* So you have to **explain what you’re trying to achieve**, and what you need from them:
	* autonomy, support, peace of mind, access to customers, data, or whatever else.
* never work in an “us against them” mode.

## 2. Be Explicit and Persistent About Your Goals
* If your **OKRs are a list of features** you’ve committed to deliver this quarter, you’re sending a clear **message: we’re a feature factory**,
* **Outcome goals** send a very different **message** — **here’s what we’re trying to achieve.**
* Tools like the North Star Metric, Top Business Metrics, and **metrics trees**
* Many PMs fail to stand their ground because they use opinions rather than evidence.
* you need to **introduce the concept of evidence** into the discussion.
* weak evidence (“one competitor did this”) with strong evidence (“Early adopter customers are using the product as we expected”).
* **get everyone into a place of true collaboration with broad shared context and clear goals**.
