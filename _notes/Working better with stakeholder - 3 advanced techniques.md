## Make Them Your Partner

* What does partnership mean? It’s an exchange of value.
* You need to **figure out what they’re really optimizing for**.
	* Making their numbers? 
	* Pushing some big initiative? 
	* Protecting against a major threat?
* So you have to **explain what you’re trying to achieve, and what you need from them**:
	* autonomy, support, peace of mind, access to customers, data, or whatever else.
* **never** work in an **“us against them”** mode.

## Be Explicit and Persistent About Your Goals

* If your OKRs are a list of features you’ve committed to deliver this quarter, you’re sending a clear message: we’re a feature factory,
* **Outcome goals send a very different message — here’s what we’re trying to achieve.**
* Tools like the North Star Metric, Top Business Metrics, and metrics trees
* **Many PMs fail to stand their ground because they use opinions rather than evidence.**
	* you need to introduce the concept of evidence into the discussion.
	* weak evidence (“one competitor did this”) with strong evidence (“Early adopter customers are using the product as we expected”).
* get everyone into a place of **true collaboration with broad shared context and clear goals**.
