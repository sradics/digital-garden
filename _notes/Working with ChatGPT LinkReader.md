# Working with ChatGPT LinkReader
## How can I extract text from a Snapshot on my computer?
+ Upload picture to Google Photos to be able to get a public URL
+ Go to the picture and share - create link to get the pulbic link
+ Open the link and copy the picture URL 
+ TextReader extract text from *the copied url*
+ Copy code and paste in Obsidian

Interestingly I discovered while trying LinkReader that you can just extract text via Google Lens directly in Google Photos (so does not need the LinkReader and ChatGPT for that).
