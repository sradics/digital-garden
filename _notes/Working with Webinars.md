95% of executives ignore this crucial skill.  
  
â†’ here's how to join the elite 5%  
  
Yesterday, I joined the Simply Doing Strategy Webinar by [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAMK_DMBJzkWYLNvJNYLK4jJCPycaoTSYRQ)[Markus Andrezak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markusandrezak/)  
  
Having been connected with Markus for several years and through various stages where he helped with strategy topics, I was impressed by his next-level approach to strategy.  
  
â†’ It moves far away from all the fluff about strategy.  
â†’ From being in the field and supporting many clients.  
â†’ Instead, it offers insights based on years of experience.  
  
I could clearly see how Markus is developing his method and perfecting his approach.  
  
Consider his Marker-Options-Work framework.  
  
Simple at first glance.  
  
But it reveals its deep value when you start applying it to your strategy work.  
  
During the webinar,  
my appetite for strategy work increased immediately (again).  
  
Did you know that 95% of executives don't engage in strategy work? It's (silly?).  
(Not sure about the 95% -- but I extract, many miss that crucial work. )  
  
Some core insights I took to my notes:  
â€”â€”  
â†’ Does your strategy shape behavior?  
â†’ READ: Play to Win by Roger L. Martin  
â†’ Consistency in strategy work matters  
â†’ You need to exercise doing strategy again and again  
â†’ Do people understand the strategy and can they the take action?  
â†’ Start simple, instead of wasting time in Meta-discussions about strategy terms  
â†’ Use the Marker-Options-Work (MOW) terms  
instead of fluffy, diluted terms like Vision, Mission bla,bla  
â†’ Start using the Play to Win canvas  
â†’ Consider the different speeds for the strategy components in MOW.  

95% don't do strategy âž  On the flip side,  
you can rise to the top quite quickly once you start with strategy.  

Simple guidance points  
â€”â€”  
â†’ use a high cadence for strategy work  
To train the strategic muscle.  
To spot problems, learn and iterate  
  
â†’ scan options and marker connection weekly for 15'  
Use the Play to Win canvas for visualization and alignment.  

âž  You are what you repeatedly do!  
  
If you want to level up your strategy game, connect with [Markus Andrezak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markusandrezak/).  
(I believe his next amazing cohort starts in February.)  

Why I'm writing about this?  
Because executing strategy well is such an important topic.  
And I haven't seen many (if any) really good implementations.  
  
With Markus's help, you can get there.  
I also want to use my reach to enable better, more impactful strategy work.  
  
Have fun exploring Markus' universe. A lot of wisdom externalized!  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
P.S.  
I help people learn how to learn, retain and recall with ease
