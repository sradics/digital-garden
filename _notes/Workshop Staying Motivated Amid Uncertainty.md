# Workshop Staying Motivated Amid Uncertainty
+ **Escape the short term thinking** and escape into the future
+ we mainly think in the ultrashort future
+ we spent a lot thinking about the next some hours - but we don't spent much time thinking about the future
+ **==our goals are too fuzzy==**, we can't see it really
+ often ==**we spent far too much time working on the obstacle**==, without having the goals really clear
+ our brain treats us in the future as strangers - and thats why we care less about our future self
+ psychological **allergy to uncertainty**

## Certainty mindset
* predictability
* ultra-short term
* efficient
* avoids overwhelm
* can respond effectively to threats
* results in psychological allergy to uncertainty

## Uncertainty mindset
* awareness
* imagination
* creativity

Data helps early stage, imagination helps future stage with higher uncertainty.

to think about the future we need the uncertainty mindset
## Think in Scenarios
A story about the future ...
+ describe environment **outside** your control
+ break inclination to predict - as objectively as possible
+ open mind to possibilities
+ reveal indicators - can identify elements of this future
+ find commonalities among scenarios

***
*3 scenarios A,B,C and elements of each scenario (x). You can see what is likely to happen, what are commonly share elements*

## How to create scenarios
+ Time - **how old** are you gonna be... /and others
+ Uncertainty - **what is the uncertainty** in your scenario
+ **another uncertainty**
+ **name and describe** the scenario
+ elaborate on **implications**
+ think about **4-5 scenarios**

*Deriving scenarios from 2 different dimensions*

## Make the vision vivid
+ what is within our control
+ make the future concrete and bridge the disconnect
+ needs to be compelling and motivating

==make it an **aspirational** future==
+ pick up great things from the past ... that you might embed in your future

## Backcasting
+ **==work back from your longer term goals==** - e.g. 3 years
+ where do I need to be in 2 years time then? What needs to happen.
+ what in 1 years time ...
+ so instead of projecting from now to the future --- start with the future and trace back
