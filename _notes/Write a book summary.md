# Write a book summary
[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdWyWK2QFRE&t=38s)
Based on [[Create an outline]]

Do a proper cleanup of the outline:
* what is missing for writing about it
* recheck the main grouping in a main point
* check for logical connection - do the sub-point connect to the main point?

Title - what to expect...

Work with Introduction and Miscellenous

Check Misc and try to put it under the existing points. And for remaining points you can still draw from it.

Let the points emerge.

Then writing ... focus on one session at a time.

Write down your first version that comes to your mind.
Intro: The topics, what will happen in the document

Cross out the items used in your preparation document.

Chapter - What can it teach us?

Explain it verbally to derive what to write about it and check the story behind that.
