* **cultivating your curiosity** (the seeds), growing your knowledge (the trees), and producing new thoughts (the fruits).
* “So plant your own gardens and decorate your own soul, instead of waiting for someone to bring you flowers.” — Jorge Luis Borges
* Short notes, long notes—it doesn’t matter as much as writing your thoughts in your own words.
* the generation effect, and it states that you better remember information when you create your own version of it.
* garden, you need to plant new ideas. The best way to do this is by replanting stems and cuttings from existing ideas you’ve added to your garden—by consistently taking notes, and combining them together, a bit like grafting
* Keeping a digital garden where you can have a shareable copy of your ideas is a great way to contribute to the growth of our collective intelligence.
