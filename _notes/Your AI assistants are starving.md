Your AI assistants are starving.  
  
â†’ Here's how to feed them properly  
  
Most people throw random prompts at AI and wonder why the responses feel generic.  
  
But here's what's missing: Context.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
This Context Engineering Loop is quite powerful  
  
â†’ and fuels AI assistants with high speed  
  
Step 1) Collect your insights  
  
Don't overthink this. Gather your thoughts, notes, frameworks - even if messy. The goal is raw material, not perfection.  
  
Step 2) Run a Gemini Deep Research  
  
Use Google One's deep research feature with specific instructions: "Create a detailed knowledge base for an AI assistant." This step transforms scattered thoughts into structured intelligence.  
  
Step 3) Build your AI assistant  
Build your AI assistant Feed that knowledge base into your assistant. With my Dr. Throughput AI assistant, this entire process takes minutes, not hours.  
  
â€”â€”â€”  
  
The magic happens in Step 2.  
  
Gemini Deep Research doesn't just organize your insights - it creates connections you hadn't seen. It identifies patterns in your thinking. It builds the foundation for AI that truly understands your context.  
  
I just used this loop to completely revise my PACT assistant.  
  
Want to see this in action?  
  
I'm running a live session this Thursday showing exactly how this works.  
  
â†’ How I go from raw context to AI assistant  
  
â†’ How the PACT AI assistant works  

Comment or DM "AI fuel" and I'll send you a notice once I open the invites.
