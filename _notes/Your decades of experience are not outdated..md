Your decades of experience aren't outdated.  
  
â†’They are AI's missing ingredient.  
  
While everyone worries about AI replacing experience,  
here's what's actually happening:  
  
â†’ AI gives generic answers  
â†’ Your battle-tested wisdom makes them specific  
â†’ That combination is unstoppable  
  
The 3-step system that changes everything:  
1) Externalize one significant experience Write down what happened, what worked, what didn't, and the lessons only you could learn.  
  
2) Create your AI context bridge Feed that story to your AI and ask: "What patterns do you see? How might this apply to my current challenges?"  
  
3) Build your wisdom worker flywheel  
  
New experiences â†’ AI analysis â†’ Better decisions â†’ More wisdom â†’ Repeat  
  
The result? AI that doesn't just know textbooks - it knows YOUR reality.  
  
â†’ Your coffee break stories become strategic insights.  
â†’ Your "been there, done that" becomes competitive advantage.  
â†’ Your experience becomes AI's secret weapon.  
  
The future belongs to wisdom workers who amplify decades of knowledge with AI intelligence.  
  
What's one hard-won lesson you could turn into AI gold?
