	* focusing on your accomplishments instead **gives you a sense of pride in what you have done**.
* When you are in a position to take action, say sitting back at your desk on Monday morning, then you can make better use of the dissatisfaction that comes from focusing on what’s not yet done.
* **Practice acceptance. One of the outcomes of many mindfulness techniques is an acceptance of your current situation.**
