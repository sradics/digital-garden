	* “other humans working for you.”
* Managing other people is incredibly messy.
* ==being a good leader and manager is a critical component of $10k work== and a tremendous opportunity for those willing to embrace it.
* ==By amplifying and influencing the work of their direct reports, good managers created heaps of leverage.==
* products that have no marginal cost of replication.
* ==Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.==
* And while Supercharge Your Productivity is one of the very few paid courses in our lineup, there will also be a free bootcamp leading up to it. Click below to let me know if you're interested and I'll reach out to you once the date is set.
