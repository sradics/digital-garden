## Highlights
* Naval Ravikant’s epic tweetstorm _How to Get Rich (without getting lucky)_
* But what is ==leverage? “The business keeps moving, when you stop working,==” is my pithy definition of leverage.

> [!quote]
> Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement. Judgement requires experience, but can be built faster by learning foundational skills.

+ Three distinct buckets of leverage: Financial Leverage, Labor, Replication

### Labor leverage

* other humans working for you.
+  [[High Output Management - Andrew S Grove]]
* Managing other people is incredibly messy.
* ==being a good leader and manager is a critical component of $10k work== and a tremendous opportunity for those willing to embrace it.
* ==By amplifying and influencing the work of their direct reports, good managers created heaps of leverage.==

### Replication Leverage
* products that have *no* marginal cost of replication.
* you can multiply your efforts without involving other humans and without needing money from other humans.

## Force Multiplier
* ==Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.==
* And while Supercharge Your Productivity is one of the very few paid courses in our lineup, there will also be a free bootcamp leading up to it. Click below to let me know if you're interested and I'll reach out to you once the date is set.
