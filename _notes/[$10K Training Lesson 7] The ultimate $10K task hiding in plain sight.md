## Highlights
* If we just ==get a little bit better each day, we'll reap tremendous long-term benefits==.
* James Clear's category-defining book [[Atomic Habits - James Clear]]. 
* Remember: your ==goals & ambitions ≠ habits==
* we make the mistake of aiming too high.
* we should focus being “heroically consistent”
* ==Four Laws Of Behavior Change==.
	* ==cue (Step 1)== sends a trigger to your brain to set off a specific behavior (an alarm, entering your bedroom, your phone buzzing)
	* ==A craving (Step 2)== for a certain feeling or emotion arises (the excitement of gambling, the calmness of alcohol)
	* ==A response (Step 3)==, the habit itself (having a drink, checking your phone)
	* ==A reward (Step 4)==, either temporary or permanent is unlocked (excitement, calmness)
* most ==powerful cues: time and location.==
	* Time: These include waking up, your afternoon coffee,
	* first thing after I wake up.
	* on Saturday mornings
	* then we can redesign our environment to make our desired habits more obvious:
* ==To remember your medication each night, place the pill bottle directly next to the faucet==
	* place the guitar stand in the middle of your living room
* To drink more water, fill up a few bottles each morning and place them across your home
* our ==habits are modern-day solutions== to very ancient desires.
	* ==Conserving energy== 
	* ==Obtaining food and water== 
	* ==Finding love and reproduce== 
	* ==Connecting and bonding with others== 
	* ==Winning social acceptance and approval== 
	* ==Reducing uncertainty== 
	* ==Achieving status and prestige==
* why am I doing this?
* ==Temptation bundling “pairs an action you want to do with an action you need to do.”==
	* For me, I drink my lemon water and do 30 pushups before I can take a sip of the magical elixir.
* ==Make it easy== The third rule is all about getting out of your own way.
	* ==By removing friction for good habits (or adding friction for bad ones) you can “stack the deck” to work in your favor.==
	* Chop up a ton of fruits and vegetables on weekends and pack them in containers, so you have easy access to healthy, ready-to-eat-options during the week.
* the fourth law increases the odds that the behavior sticks.
* This strategy shows the power of habit tracking,
* ==“What gets measured, gets mastered”==
* ==Creates a visual cue that can remind you to act==
	* Is inherently motivating because you see the progress and don’t want to lose it (think Snapchat streaks)
	* Feels satisfying whenever you record a successful instance
* ==“never miss twice.”== If you miss one day, keeping that momentum by getting back on track as soon as possible.
* Finally, ==to break a bad habit, there's also the inversion of the 4th law: Make it unsatisfying.==
* tap into our core human desire: ==avoiding social rejection.==
* ==getting an accountability partner==,
* Being even more public about your habits (via, Social Media) can make the costs of violating your promises public and painful.
