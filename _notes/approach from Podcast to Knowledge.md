## Content preparation
Through the following 6 steps I transform from passive listening to a Podcast to actively applied knowledge.

1) I take hand written notes while listening to the Podcast (Bonus: Listen with 1.5x speed)
2) Convert notes to digital text using ChatGPT image to text converter
3) Add a new note to my Second Brain in Obsidian and take highlights - make it tangible for the next time I will use it
4) Link to existing notes in my Second Brain - reflect on the insights and wire it with existing knowledge
5) Publish the notes in my publicly available Digital Garden - write in public 
6) Express my knowledge e.g. in Form of a LinkedIn post - a first application of my new learnings
