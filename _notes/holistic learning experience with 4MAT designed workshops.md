ðŸŒŸ Your holistic learning experience with 4MAT designed workshops ðŸŒŸ  

I used the 8 octants of the 4MAT Model to design a workshop that creates a holistic learning experience.  
  
The attached slides show a sneak preview for the session design for the upcoming workshop:  
â€” Amplify your Second Brain and Digital Garden with AI â€” provided next week on 04.06. in the [Ness Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nesslabs/) community.  

Here the 8 octants on an overview  
(I recommend to read in parallel with the slides to connect to an example):  
  
ðŸ”¹ 1. Connect (Why/Feel) ðŸ”¹  
Start with a personal story or a surprising fact to connect emotionally with your audience.  
This sets the stage by highlighting the importance and relevance of the content.  
  
ðŸ”¹ 2. Attend (Why/Think) ðŸ”¹  
I use engaging questions or reflective prompts.  
To encourage participants to think about their own experiences related to the topic.  
This deepens their curiosity and involvement.  
  
ðŸ”¹ 3. Image (What/Feel) ðŸ”¹  
I ask attendees to explore what becomes possible.  
This helps participants create mental images that enhance understanding and retention.  
  
ðŸ”¹ 4. Inform (What/Think) ðŸ”¹  
I present clear, structured information through lectures, demonstrations, or readings.  
To build a solid knowledge foundation.  
  
ðŸ”¹ 5. Practice (How/Feel) ðŸ”¹  
I embed hands-on activities where participants can practice new skills.  
In a collaborative setting!  
  
ðŸ”¹ 6. Extend (How/Think) ðŸ”¹  
I encourage participants to apply what theyâ€™ve learned to real-world scenarios.  
Offering different routes, tailored to individual learning styles  
  
ðŸ”¹ 7. Refine (What if/Feel) ðŸ”¹  
Partici  
ðŸ”¹ 8. Perform (What if/Think) ðŸ”¹  
I challenge participants to innovate and experiment with their new knowledge.  
  
ðŸ‘‰ Maybe weâ€™ll see each other next week?
