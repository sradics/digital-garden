How I overcome that Blank Page
 
 â†’ A Journey in Note-Taking and Tool Exploration

Are you struggling with taking notes? 

I started three years ago with blank pages.
Unsure of what to write. 
Unsure where to begin. 

Then I realized that I had already gathered so much information. 
â‡¢ I worked with many great teams and individuals.
â‡¢ I worked in several professions. 
â‡¢ I gave dozens of workshops.
â‡¢ I read hundreds of books.

And yet, I struggled with a blank page!

Really? 

Here's how I tackled it:
with Mindset, Tooling and Structure.

â†’ Identify Starting Points
â€”â€”â€”
â‡¢ Make a list of all the content you created in the past. 
â‡¢ Discover your favorite problems or topics you want to work on.

Feynman's approach of working on your 12 favorite problems helped me a lot. (I add a link to my current 12 in the comments). 

â†’ Choose the Right Tool
â€”â€”â€”
For me, this tool is Obsidian. 

When I first opened Obsidian, I felt overwhelmed by the options. 
But I remembered how I had learned other tools in the past.

â‡¢ Get into daily usage
â‡¢ Explore the options and
â‡¢ Practice, practice, practice

You can improve significantly in a short period 
when you practice daily.

â†’ Get Started 
â€”â€”â€”
I recommend the great tutorials by Nick Milo to get started with Note-Making. And how to use Obsidian. 

Just begin!

It may take one to two hours to create your first notes and links.

But then you'll discover the joy it brings:
â‡¢ being creative, 
â‡¢ being in the writing
â‡¢ expressing yourself

My recommendation:
â€”â€”â€”
Follow the 1% method from Atomic Habits by James Clear. 

Improve by 1% every day, 
and you'll see significant progress in one or two weeks. 

Note-taking will become second nature over time.
And maybe you will soon become a Note-Maker too?

What is your ONE tip to overcome a blank page?
