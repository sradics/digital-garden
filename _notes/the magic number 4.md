# the magic number 4
[[What is a desired outcome?]]

The number four has been called “magic” due to [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11515286) indicating it seems to be the natural limit of all sorts of cognitive processes, from working memory to object-tracking to rapid enumeration. In more speculative findings, some primitive tribes seem to have specific words only up to the number four, and many animals seem to be able to distinguish up to four individual objects.
