## Highlights
* productivity system should ideally consist of ==four essential things==: 
	* A ==task manager== (for me Asana)
	* A ==digital calendar==  (for me Google Calendar)
	* A ==note-taking app==  (for me Obsidian and Remarkable)
	* An ==email app== (for me Google Mail)
* ==task manager== can also be ==paired up with your calendar== so that you plan your tasks and also make time to do them.
	* I can think of further coupling Asana and Gmail
* ==apps== that can help you do this include ==Routine, Amie, and Sunsama==.
* email managers that ==emphasize on fast sorting and hitting inbox zero==. Some of my personal recommendations include Superhuman, Big Mail and Spark.
	* for me gmail is working quite fine
